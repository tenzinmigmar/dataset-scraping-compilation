"Apr. 7, 2022",Racism suspected here,I really wish they'd let you see what's on offer before you have to subscribe. In fact I'd go as far as saying it's a form of gambling. I'm buying a product and have no idea what I'll receive or if it's the right product for my needs. That doesn't sit right with me and personally I think it should be changed. In reality it won't ever be changed because they know that people will just look at what's on offer and go elsewhere unless there's good content. You see where I'm going with this...,1

Yet again, they've messaged me to say their prices are increasing AGAIN!  I explained I can't afford an increase.  I got the usual customer service nonsense about their programmes have really improved, etc.hence the price increase.  But they really haven't!  I struggle to find anything worth watching.  Customer service weren't the slightly bit interested and sent me an email with instructions on how to rejoin when I change my mind.  Avoid and use other streaming services.",1
"Apr. 3, 2022",Absolutely horrible customer service,Visited tunisia and used my account blacklist up to season 7 was available to watch I also download on my phone. Get home and no blacklist on uk Netflix try to watch my downloads and told not possible in this country. I feel us in Britain are seen as people to make the most money out of us and  get extra charges out of us and we just pay well I'm looking into other suitable subscriptions that don't discriminate you and make you pay more for being British.,1
"Apr. 3, 2022","Arrogant with customers, poor range of programmes/films","After years I've decided to quit Netflix.

Thats was the biggest mistake I made is taking Netflix through my phone company. They offer only one screen, then I upgraded to premium and my husband traveled because we travels and now we can't watch netflix overseas with our account. Netflix is now telling us to make two accounts and pay two separate bills. Netflix suggested that we make an account overseas and keep one here in the United States. This is totally nonsense.",1

When I'm in germany - ENGLISH movies are in GERMAN language => cant turn it off, the movie only has 1 language: german - insane. Same goes for Spain, Portugal, Hungary...

"Updated Apr. 12, 2022",Netflix sending phising 🎣 texts.,"We had an account and money was tight so we couldn't pay for a few weeks. Understandably, our account was suspended. No problems there.Except when we did finally pay, they informed us that it'd take a week for the service to come back. So instead of paying for a full month of use we'd be paying for 3 weeks and then paying for the next month. See the problem?Then we asked for a refund and they said itd take a week to process. So taking our money was instant but giving it back takes a while. Mhm. Plus selections are limited. I can count a few hundred times I've wanted to watch something but it wasnt on Netflix. But theyre quick to create new shows with tiktokers that cant act and such, knowing that their fandom which is mostly teens and children will ask their parents for an account to support their faves. They're a money thirsty company that doesn't care for quality and goes for the quick buck.",1

I had literally no idea how they even got that CC number. When I signed back in, to confirm the account number,  was signed back up again (because it automatically signs you back up any timeYou sign in).

"Mar. 13, 2022",Disappointing,"I enjoy Netflix, but the decision to increase prices (whilst consumers are already facing massive cost of living hikes) just to pose more of a threat against it’s competition is selfish and greedy.

"Mar. 9, 2022",Feel I’ve been betrayed by Netflix,App works fine .streaming works fine.To be honest any thing I watch I've seen before there is very little original stuff to see that I have not watch before. the biggest flaw is that I let my mbership run down as I was going to change it from a single user to one that my whole family could use obviously for more money...but 4 days before it ends I keep getting emails and warnings saying my account is on hold...to me that means I can't use it so is very off putting and it was only by chance that I realised I could Netflix know exactly what there doing wording it like that......so that's another customer you have lost that was going to stay and pay more.,1

I was a long time subscriber and was locked into a good price then suddenly my account was inaccessible and had just paid for the new months.

So I sure it was just a way to get me off a lower pricing plan so they could start charging everyone more. The quality of shows also went way down.,4
"Mar. 7, 2022",Netflix sucks,"No one can answer the question I posed . The customer service rep couldn’t and the text messenger couldn’t. So my complaint and issue with Netflix revolves around their need and timing to raise rates AGAIN? My unanswered question is ., Why would Netflix raise rates when their profits are at their highest and would go higher as we have become shut ins during this pandemic?? I signed up when it was 7.99 a month and now they want 19.99.

And to cap it all off, they LIED about it.You heard me right, just like how Disney supports communist genocide, terrorism and murder of innocent Uighur Muslims in CCP-controlled China, Pedoflix supports the genocide, terrorism and murder of innocent Ukranians by the evil Vladimir Putin and his fascist, Nazi-esque soldiers. As someone who hates Putin, his anti-LGBT views and the fact he's trying to bring the Soviet Union back, and is horrified with what's going on with Ukraine and supports them, I am even more disgusted with Pedoflix than I am now and want them to shut down even quicker, and if anyone still uses it/wants to have a subscription, they are some of the biggest fools to walk the Earth.It feels so hopeless knowing that despite all this terror going on, that there are still Pedoflix supporters who will just treat this as another bit of internet drama that everyone would just move on from after the majority of people got bored of it, while remaining fully content with still using their Pedoflix subscriptions to ""watch something else"" or get easily distracted by the next pretty looking film or series, not feeling uncomfortable with still giving them financial support in the slightest (Ancient Roman bread and circuses, anyone?), shows that they not only have the worst priorities ever, basically don't care about whatever future the kids and people of the next generation are gonna be growing up into nor the innocent Ukrainians getting slaughtered and how their lives are changed for the worse, nor the innocent Russians who hate Putin and are against this invasion and the possibility of war (just as bad as some Tw@tter posters I've seen even). It's bad enough also that Stranger Things season 3 (Stranger Things was never really that good, to be frank) had awful, xenophobic anti-Russian propaganda (even if it was supposed to represent the Red Scare it was HORRENDOUSLY EXECUTED), but I have a feeling it's going to get even worse when season 4 comes (and even then and there, the damage is done as most ST fans did not like season 3 and are not going to give the rest of the series a chance), even after it was already filmed.Nobody should be supporting or giving money to Pedoflix after this.  They have not only proven that they are full of child molesters, rape glorifiers, a possible Satanic pedophile cult/trafficking ring and Cult of Woke scumbags who think that being born with white/Caucasian skin, as a male, and as religious/Christian automatically makes you an intrinsically and never-changing racist, sexist, homophobe/transphobe or some other bigot in their mentally unhinged mind, but, considering how Putin wants to revive the Soviet Union, they've crossed the line too far once again, showing that they're now ☭ scumbags who don't give a sh!t about your First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Constitutional, Civil, or basic human rights, and they deserve to lose all of their business and all the executives thrown into prison for their crimes against nature and humanity.A wise man stands with Ukraine. 🇺🇦",5

We don't get anywhere near to the programming and selection that Netflix gives it's customers in the States, but we get rate increases year after year. You already took payment for this month but you won't be getting another cent from me as your fees aren't worth the programming you provide. At least with Amazon Prime I pay one fee for the year and am more than satisfied with the service they provide.  Netflix is a ripoff plain and simple.",1

One agent to my friend told me that she is not able to answer such questions, she can help with account and troubleshooting. Third agent to one of my friends told me that they are nonpartisan and dont choose the side. Advise from the person who leads support team- if you have peak on one topic,  at least prepare decent answer to your customers - show empathy/ and give explanation. Oh but wait “, netfix forgot what empathy means. In the name of God, and in the face of war which is happening, people, kids are dying you decide (quote from netflix agent) choosing a side. Are you serious???? We, your customers, are waiting for decent decision. We, decent world with the moral stand unite and dont support war nor Russian propaganda and we request for the answer.

Keep in mind that the Co-Founder of Netflix, Marc Randolph, is directly related to both Sigmund Freud and Edward Bernays (The father of modern propaganda). Almost every Netflix original series or show has wild one sided propaganda laced throughout all the way down to the kids shows.Netflix isn't like it was when it was a DVD rental company... it is an outright propaganda mill.I've been absolutely shocked at the agenda laced throughout the childrens shows as well as the shows that are supposed to be ""documentaries"" (which should be non-bias and about the facts.I never write online reviews but I've been so absolutely disgusted by what I see on Netflix lately that I had to write something about it somewhere.

"Feb. 27, 2022","Crappy quality, worse customer support...","How I feel about Netflix. Netflix is a great platform much better than any televsion cable television currently. And certainly a larger variety of shows than any other streaming service currently available.Netflix also has incredible options like allowing multiple users on one account. Or that they are always adding new content to their streaming service. Everyday, Netflix is looking to add more shows. Some people complain that netflix has shows, but it's hard to tell what art is good and what is bad. Usually Netflix's algorithm will be able to provide you with shows that are interesting for you and not other people. And while i write all of these positive things there is really one thing that separates netflix from a 5 star and 3 star. And that's their use of subtitles. Netflix butchers the subtitles on everything show and series of theres. For absolutely no reason. I for the life of me cannot understand it. If a character canc say a sentence with his mouth then someone can read at the same pace.If someone does not want to read subtitles, he can just deactivate them.But don't butcher all the subtitles on your site in order to appeal so some bull sheet aesthetic. Netflix could be great. But they need to fix the user experience so that users can know that what they are reading is actually what's going on in the plot. Because the way they handle it right now does not provide us with that clarity.",1

Netflix is so far above any of those other streaming providers that it's on a completely different level. Of course not everything is fantastic but there's virtually always something worth watching and new content is added all the time. I do have a break from Netflix from time to time but always find there're just two or three things worth watching on the other streaming sites and then I return. It's always the same low consistent price. I just have basic which is fine for me. Now and again there's something that's very dark and it can look quite pixelated but that's about it technical wise. Your account just manages itself. There's nothing to do. Cancelling and restarting is super easy.

Then 75% of the time it would turn out the movie is either Russian or some other country where there mouths move different from what is being said. There are way to many foreign movies on Netflix and it really don't make no sense. Some are OK, but there is just way to many. At least make a place to chose if you want to watch foreign or not instead of putting everything all together . I'm american and want to watch movies in English that I understand. Go to categories and select horror then look at all the foreign language movies that is on there. If it wasn't for the walking dead, Ozark, ash vs evil dead, breaking bad and some movies then I would never watch it. I think Tubi is a better app than Netflix by a long shot.

"Jan. 27, 2022",STOP REGIONAL CONTENT,excellent platform great variety of series and movies,3
"Jan. 26, 2022",Good platform for series and movies,"I love Netflix, lots of variety and the platform is very easy to use :)",5
"Jan. 26, 2022",Ok Hi everyone,during pandemic I have been addicted to Netflix and really liked some of the  series they produced especially Witcher. Loving the second season.,5
"Jan. 26, 2022",My favourite platform,You have removed all the decent series movies and now paid HARRY AND MEGHAN $100 million dollars to show their crap. Are you so unaware that you’re WASTING YOUR CLIENTS MONEY. Virtually no one here have any intention of supporting pathetic duo do??IF YOU PUT IT ON.....YOU WILL LOSE THOUSANDS OF YOUR CUSTOMERS,5
"Jan. 26, 2022",Condescending unhelpful twa*ts that…,Very poor customer service.Netflix lost a customer today due to the poor service on the online chat service. I also feel the costs have now created a poor value option. I won't return.,1
"Jan. 25, 2022",Netflix not a fan,They have good shows but if the price keeps going up like it has they are going to start to lose customers.  I know for me if it goes up again I'm dumping them!,1
"Jan. 24, 2022",I quit paying on my acct,"GOOD: They have some good shows, and series. No commercials,  BAD: price, they raised it again. Basic 9.99, better at 15.99 and best at 19.99. Thats ridiculous.  Won't go back till they lower the price. Also, they need to get rid of the kid like porn, they got rid of Christian based shows.",1
"Jan. 24, 2022",Great variety,I feel that there’s always excessive use of bad language being used on pretty much every series !!.. I feel that the media is encouraging foul language and and normalising within society as a whole. I’m beginning to get a bit put off tbh and now thinking to end my membership.,5
"Jan. 24, 2022",good service,"Not bad overall, but sometimes the translation is bad. The character's names are inconsistent in different episodes or seasons 🤨",4
"Jan. 24, 2022",Terrible on many levels,Some great stuff on there. Delaying the release of After Life 3 a little immature,1
"Updated Jan. 24, 2022",My account has been hacked twice in the…,"Great platform, with lots of original content",2
"Jan. 22, 2022",Got a Netflix gift card,"Very enjoyable, gives you a lot of options with movies and documentaries",1
"Updated Jan. 22, 2022",Garbage customer service,"The shows they make are mostly fine or at least the ones I have watched have been pretty good however their customer support is based on blaming the ISP for every issue they have. I've had them claim I am using a VPN and then when I say I am not they say the ISP has marked my IP address as using a VPN which is ridiculous as in the UK they assign you a new IP every time you disconnect from the internet or restart the router I've had to talk to them a dozen times and the final straw when I messaged them to tell them what the solution to the latest issue was was that they just ended the chat. I don't use VPNs, proxies or ""unblockers"" as they call them I'm just trying to view a show that they assured me is available in my region and it should be because I've been watching it for like a week.",1
"Jan. 21, 2022",excellent platform,"I recently contacted Netfilx Customer Service via chat and phone in regards to trialing the Premium Service for a week to a month without having to pay the Premium fee. I was advised that this can't be done, I find for a billion dollar company this response for loyal customer who has been with them for 20 months very disappointing. To make thing worst I asked for a call back and was advise Netflix don't provide this service. As they say in Australia ""Not Happy Jan""",5
"Jan. 20, 2022",good platform,"Crap! Pure crap!They seldom add new content and when they do it is old movies, but they remove content too. That is a major thing for me. You don't remove stuff that I pay for.Also they ruin their own shows and cancel them left n' right...but put them on anyways for people to watch, unknowingly that there is no second session. Just to put people off.IF i could give negative star rating I would...like -5",3
"Jan. 19, 2022",I love Netflix,"Oh! the pleasure of watching a film on Netflix ad free is so much more enjoyable. They have a frequent turnover of films and quality documentaries which means at around £6 per month they are outstanding value.One minor quibble,I did rely on the Netflix viewers reviews as I believe they were more accurate than a professional reviewer whose objectively could be influenced by the film studio who's film he/she was reviewing.",5
"Jan. 19, 2022",during pandemic I have been addicted to…,1 They buy the rights to a show then ruin it 2 they Love making film with twerking children 3 all the Netflix origins are lazy,5

"Jan. 18, 2022",Very poor customer service.,"Lots of movies, both stories, and documentaries. I really enjoyed the entertaining platform.",1
"Jan. 18, 2022",They have good shows but if the price…,I subscribed recently! There is a lot of choices I really like it!,3
"Jan. 18, 2022","GOOD shows, high prices.",In England  absolutely ru ish not worth paying for,2
"Jan. 18, 2022",I feel that there’s always excessive…,"Very few decent films on TV these days. Amazon prime looks as if it offers no end of choice but take a closer look and anything decent is “available to rent” so bit of a con. Netflix on the other hand is head and shoulders above the aforementioned with a huge choice of films all included in the subscription. Also some fantastic Netflix originals such as The Crown, Unorthodox and The Queens Gambit to name a few. Others may disagree with my choices but there really is something on here for all tastes. Netflix helped me get through lockdown and for that alone I’d happily award 5 stars.",1
