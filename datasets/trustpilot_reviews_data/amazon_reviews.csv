"April 19, 2022",Avoid unless you want robbed,"Purchased a hip support for my dog through amazon, it was delivered less than 40 minutes ago, went on my account as the support isn't as described and not fit for purpose and my statutory rights say i can retirn within 14 days, amazon return policy state that exact information also, they won't let me return as apparently its a non returnable item even though I wasn't made aware of this anywhere, amazon will not help they just keep ending chat on me, this support cost £97.50 so thats a big loss, I can't contact the seller as they have no contact details there so I have been ripped off and amazon won't help at all. This to me is fraudulent activity.",1
"April 19, 2022",Amazon customer service calling is ridiculous and they are no help at all!!!,"I have found items that I needed on sale and after I ordered Amazon canceled the day after it was said to be ""out for delivery "" I called to complain and they kept asking me the same questions I had already answered SEVERAL times! When I told them that I had already answered them more than one and they keep asking the same questions I already answered they put me on hold. While I was on hold I was talking to someone beside me about how ridiculous it is that they can't understand what i said the first time and the lady whom I was talking to (customer service supervisor) gets back on and is rude telling me ""your call is being monitored what did you just say"" when I told her I wasn't talking to her and that I was talking to someone beside me and I don't have to tell her what I said to someone else she got mad and hung up! These people need to learn to listen the first time so others don't have to keep repeating themselves and not get but hurt over someone saying that they obviously don't understand or aren't listening!",1

A day ago,Several times happened,"Several times happened. I ordered online. Amazon gave me time window. Just a few minutes before end of the due for no reason my orders canceled. I understand this issue could be happen. But the main problem is Amazon doesn't care about how is the costumers feeling. I tried to tell them my complain is about  my time. Amazon waist my time and I need my orders, although they try to make me happy with 5 dollars credit offer. I said this is insulting whenever people talk about humanity and customers respect, but the still tried to buy my waist time with 5 dollars gift card. I just disappointed because feels like Amazon already grows up and don't need to respect or responsibility about customers. Even Worse than that is costumer services that act like robot or some technology without any understanding. I recommended to send me my order after at least another two hours chat with costumer service but they passed me to the other person and it repeated several times and each time they asked me to explain again my story. I know billion dollars corporation don't even look at our rights but I'm sure where ever any system ignore humans they will fall in the end. For my part, I will close my Amazon account forever.  I hope no one else has such an experience that I had.",1
A day ago,I placed an order,"I placed an order, being told it would be the next day, when I clicked on place order and it came through I have to wait till June for it, I placed a similar order within minutes and it will be here tomorrow. How does that work. Amazon is becoming over priced and unreliable on it orders also the packaging that the items comes in is not exactly environmentally friendly",1

"April 17, 2022",Bad show Amazon.…,A bit sick of Amazon continually pushing Prime in our face. Both my wife and I have had enough. My wife had £7.99 a month taken off for ages before noticing this. She had not knowingly signed up. Bad show Amazon think we're done.,2
"April 17, 2022",Prime gets you no service.,"Basically Amazon offers Prime for consumers to pay for better service, but as the price goes up, the level of service declines. I've had several instance where promised next day or 2 day shipping has slipped for several days, and now returns are also not going like they used to. I had a return approved on April 9, shipped it back April 10 via UPS, Amazon received it April 12 but as of today, April 17, they haven't even acknowledged receipt of the item. I went on a support chart where the representative confirmed the receipt and then quickly closed out the chat session before I could ask any follow-up questions. Since they're having issues with too many returns, I don't expect this will improve, just get worse.",1

"April 15, 2022",So sad ...after being an Amazon…,So sad ...after being an Amazon customer for many years I can honestly say I am done. The customer service is so bad it's as if they can't even see your order on their end. The only solution they give you is refund or they conveniently disconnect the call/ chat. No reason to pay for prime since they are always late on delivery.,1

After cutting 2 quilts, the lines were gone from the rulers making them unusable. I contacted Amazon for refund and sent the rulers back. Now Amazon processed the return and marked 1 returned and are saying I will be charged again for the other 2. There were 3 rulers in the box. I am furious at the bad system that doesn't check what has come in for returns. As it was, we think the rulers were cheap fakes because this is a ruler I use for 15 plus years. It seems to have been a false copy of the real ruler. What happened to Amazon? It is no longer the company it used to be.",1
"April 14, 2022",DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Amazon locked me out of my account for no reason.  I made a payment via the method I have done for years.  They blocked me in November 2021 and didnt send me the message they said that they had done.  I still do not have access and today received an email asking me to login and submit information.  Absolute joke, how can I log in if I am locked out.  I have tried every possible way to speak to a person and when I have managed to get my way through the rejection emails the advisors just send a scripted response that doesnt even answer or even make sense wit what I am asking.  Seriously need to give me access as I bought £100s of Amazon Echo and Firesticks.  I had extra subscriptions for all services too which were cancelled rendering my items useless.",1

"Apr. 10, 2022",Close to impossible to even tell them what the problem is.,"Customer service is horrible.  One of the biggest frustrations is that unless your problem falls into one of their predetermined boxes there is no way to even let them know what the problem is.

And don't get me started on Prime and how they try every dirty trick in the book - and a few others besides - to get you to sign up or persuade you to continue with your membership when you choose  to cancel it.

Not having a printer in my home, I had the company send me a label via the U.S.Postal System.  Amazon saw the need to charge $1.00 for this ""service"".  It was THEIR mistake in sending me the wrong book and then putting me through the hassle of returning the book.  I see no need in adding insult to injury by charging me for providing the return label and will be buying my books and other items previously purchased from the company elsewhere.

So I submitted a negative review ... that didn't get published despite not having broken any review rules. It was a product with a very high sales volume thus it appears like Amazon was trying to fend out negative reviews for its cash cow, despite the issue with the mouse apparently having been a common issue...

Then they said that I had possibly been hacked but refused to give me further details… (what?!!). Was I hacked? I said I found it unlikely that someone would hack my account solely to leave reviews. What is the evidence??SO, what I take from this is they only want POSITIVE REVIEWS for some companies, and if you leave a negative one for one of their sponsored companies, they will ban you.  No freedom of speech. Everything being censored. Buy, buy, buy, we don’t care about you, the customer…like what? I tried to resolve this and they totally refused to listen.

Amazon has been a life saver through this Covid plandemic and although I don't agree with it's owner or his principals, I am very thankful for the service they are providing to people who need it!",1

"Mar. 29, 2022",Bad vary bad 👎,"We are stuck at home in a rural area with COVID so ordered something we needed through Prime for next day delivery.The delivery didn't turn up and we have asked for and received no explanation as to why. The customer service said they had no way of contacting the depot to find out...Some customer service!!!Living in a rural area and having very little opportunity to get deliveries this should have been a lifeline. Amazon prioritise 2 hour and same day deliveries rather than assuring we all get next day delivery. I have no access to these services because of where I live but still have to pay the same. The least we expect is to get our next day delivery. If Amazon want to provide a two tier service, there should be two tiers of payments as we are second class to them.",1
"Mar. 29, 2022",Problem solved,"So after updating for Prime, I was expecting free shipping as promised. After that, I selected product and wanted to buy, but there was no shipping. When I asked support, he said that international shippings don't provide free shipping.. Then, he said to set a filter to select the products with a free shipping. I asked him WHERE, he said if I see the filter on the left side. I said yes I see, but I don't see anything about filtering the free-shipping and non free shipping products..After I told him that, he asked me for a zip code, and then left the chat.. isn't this funnynot only that prime is totally shi*less, but I spent my time on BS",4

"Mar. 29, 2022",So after updating for Prime,"I made an amazon account because i was given an amazon gift card. I purchased a roblox gift card using the amazon gift card, and my amazon account was locked because somehow me buying a roblox card is suspicious. Whatever. I put in my information to get my account unlocked, and a few hours later, my account still wasn't unlocked. However a new notification appeared when i tried to log in saying they reviewed the information i sent but they still need more. It said to follow the instructions in the text message they sent me, but the text message they sent me tells me to log in, but when i log in it tells me i need to follow the text message instructions. Makes sense? No? Great because i was confused too. The text message had no ""instructions"". I called customer service and the tl; dr is ""sorry idk how to help u lol bye"". I thought i would just try again and make a new account, so i did. I tried to load my gift card again and it said the gift card was locked.Tl; dr - amazon locked my account the moment i tried to buy something, and froze my amazon gift card essentially stealing 25 dollars from me with no hope of getting it back.How can you avoid an experience like this?Dont buy from amazon. Buy from the home store of the sellers on amazon. Not only does it keep money out of greedy bezos's pockets, not only can it be cheaper than buying from amazon, but it also helps you avoid every single painful moment i spent on the amazon website. This was quite literally the worst experience ive ever had while on the internet. Dont ask for amazon gift cards for your birthday or christmas. Ask for visa gift cards. Theyre like amazon gift cards except you can buy anything, not just amazon stuff.Final thoughts - my first impressions of amazon are as followed: amazon scammed me out of my money, if your account gets locked (which i guess happens every time you try to buy something?) just give up and delete your account because you aren't gonna get it back. Did you have gift cards loaded onto that account? Say bye bye to that money because you just got scammed. Avoid amazon at all costs.",1
"Mar. 29, 2022",Go Amazon,"Be very aware Amazon uses more than on date on return items. There are 2 return by dates. I ended up having wasting a bunch of time on my end for them to ""do me a favor"" and extend the items another 5 days after losing income to return the items initially and then having to take additional time off of work to return them again. When you request a return. the initial return by date will be one date, but after you select your reason for return and method for return the return by date is a day later. Guess which date is used when you go to drop off the items. I spent an hour trying to get someone to fix my issues (spoiler alert: they did not fix my issue) while FedEx closed. I then had to just call them directly and rearrange my schedule again within the 5 day extension. I can't believe this is acceptable.",5
"Mar. 28, 2022",stole my money and locked my account,"I'm just learning that the annual Amazon Prime membership for free shipping, isn't free shipping at all. What's worse is the many sellers who sell under the free shipping banner advertising, are actually sneaking in shipping fees that are being advertised as free shipping for prime members, and Amazons stance on this practice, is they refuse to do anything because these people are off site sellers, yet their allowing them to use the free shipping banner, regardless!January of 2022, clicked the subscribe and save free shipping for two 16 ounce containers of catnip temptations cat treats at $7.99 each, totaling $15.98 plus tax. Thanks to my banks fraud system, got notified several days later of a charge attempt for $190.13, that was only approved day of sale for $17.22. Upon looking at the invoice that was awaiting payment revision, saw that Amazon snuck in an $80 each, Shipping and Handling fee. I ended up canceling not just that order, but every subscribe and save item. It wasn't that all the other items had similar fees, they just all happened to go up over $20 for each item on day they were to ship out.Bounty paper towels quick size, another example of their free shipping, was $22 for 16 rolls which day of attempted shipping this March, jumped to $48!!! Target had the same exact item at $16.99. I purchased three bags at Target instead.Charmin Ultima strong toilet paper 24 pack, this March price jumped to $38.17, but again Targets price was only $19.22.Let's now get to the 48x18x82 shelves. Same shelf same model and manufacturer from Amazon prime is $149.99 plus tax. Just about every seller, selling under the free Amazon prime shipping had $49.99 shipping charges snuck in, and several reps I talked to in chat, said this was fine, including their fulfilled by Amazon sellers.Using both the UPS and USPS shipping calculators ran six different items. Coffee, dish soap, laundry detergent, milk, soda, and sugar. Matching these prices to the stores, discovered the big price difference on Amazon was because each of those items, had the shipping cost added to the items. Your not getting free shipping when you pay the prime fees. The shipping is already added to the over inflated prices. And if it's not, it's sold under their free shipping banner, with the shipping snuck in! I may not get 5% back using my credit card on Amazon, but the 2 or 3% I am getting from going to my local market or Target, is a heck of a huge savings, compared to the false free shipping Amazon is definitely not giving me in the first place. Trust Pilot, please make it so reporters like myself can include screenshots of what we're reviewing. It looks much better when you can show a ripoff, then just put it in writing. Thanks.If this is helpful, please mark it as such. Normally I just report on bad gaming companies, but with the hardship people are still suffering from the Pandemic, I do my best now to make everyone aware of all scams I see. Take care and be safe!",1

No way to communicate with the seller or Amazon to rectify the problem. A bad situation, frustrated by a bad selling/buying platform.

All I could say is I didn’t receive the item since they give you a limited number of responses to their questions. Their was no way I could tell them I received a picture of their delivery but I have no idea what house it was delivered to. There is no other way to send feedback to their customer ‘no service’!  Their delivery folks obviously lack an attention to detail but there is no mechanism to give this feedback to Amazon.

Amazon claims to have the worlds' best customer service but compared to other suppliers I use I find their CS pretty sub-standard. They do just enough so that you don't call a lawyer.

A few months ago they placed a note when I went to place a review that there had been ""unusual reviewing activity, all my reviews have been removed and I will not be able to place reviews anymore."" I called to get this issue taken care of, they sent me a link to their review guidelines. I read them and didn't violate One rule! I use reviews to let other know about a product and also to ask questions. Asking questions, I'm no longer allowed to do either. So I called Amazon back again a couple of months later. I thought this time the issue was taken care of, NO it isn't!! So I emailed them. No response from Amazon at all!! Amazon Prime will be $139 when my membership is due again. If I can't have use of ALL the perks, including placing reviews & asking questions, then either Amazon can lower the cost of my membership or I will drop it!

"Mar. 21, 2022",The worst shopping experience I've ever…,"Look, there are some basic things people seem to have experienced at Amazon. Everyone seems to know: their tools for sale are virtually all made with soft foreign steel and will bend, strip or break; their textiles are all made in foreign factories and will fall apart, tear or dissolve when washed; any reviews submitted for a product that mentions how it could potentially be dangerous will not be published in what appears to be a phony “we try to make our reviews honest” section; an large amount of their electronic products are claimed to be grey market items, not supported by a manufacturers warranty; a huge percentage of their ‘name brand’ products are counterfeit; you will pay more at Amazon for any given product as it is most likely very cheaply made and could break, fall apart or even catch fire in a relatively short time requiring you to search for an honest vendor and spend again to purchase a dependable product; and if you think you have found a name brand product you feel safe to purchase you can comparison shop at a local big box store and probably find it less expensive, and, finally, get told your item was delivered when it wasn’t, ‘handed directly to resident’ being their favorite phony baloney story while never having a picture taken of either whom it was delivered to or of the house the handoff allegedly took place at. I find that very suspicious, don’t you? I mean considering they take a picture whenever they just leave it. So summarizing all of these apparent realities leaves little reason to do business with Amazon, or complain again and again about these issues. I’m finding great deals at small web sites and big box stores and although it won’t matter to them, I’m purchasing at these other stores. I feel better because I do.",1

The button on the right said continue and I clicked on it before realising that in a small print underneath that it said 'with Amazon Prime' and that the button to just continue without buying Prime was in tiny blue font on the other side of the screen.

There are other places that require same work and give less pay. For someone that's resilient and wants to have a career at Amazon, someone who has a real desire and dedication will definitely get promoted (I'm not talking for own experience as I didn't work there for a long time, I'm talking about knowing people that worked there for a little time but they were dedicated and interested in improving and they got promoted fairly quickly than in other places).

"Mar. 18, 2022",A live human is impossible to reach at…,"In many years of ordering from Amazon, I've never had anything but positive experiences...until now! Two weeks ago I ordered some iron sachets - simply never turned up. I re-ordered with a few other bits and pieces including some car polish - that turned up today with the notification 'handed to resident'. I returned home to find the cardboard package just left at the front door absolutely sodden due to today's downpours. Fortunately the product was unaffected. Unfortunately I can't say the same for another item 'handed to resident', some grass seed for which the packaging was so badly damaged that half the seed was in the plastic bag it was wrapped in. I now have the inconvenience of returning and having to either wait to re-order or pay for P&P due to the order value. It surely can't be a coincidence that the wheels have come off so quickly.",1
"Mar. 17, 2022",Closed account for no good reason,"Amazons customer service has gone so badly down hill. They received my return but have failed to refund me. It’s taken several phone calls which including them hanging up on me repeatedly even though I was pleasant calm and friendly enough. I tried the online chat to which every time I explained the whole situation  suddenly they loose connection and I’d have to try again. This happened 7 times in two hours. Amazon used to issue a refund the minute Hermes scanned in the collection now you have to wait weeks for your money back. Once upon a time if you received a faulty product they would amend it immediately. Now you have to battle for a refund. I’ve found I’ve had to contact their customer service more than ever before for various issues and each time I’m served by someone who has no idea what I’m saying who’s rude hostile abs has no time to help at all. Once upon a time the customer service at Amazon was second to non. The staff would be beyond helpful, kind, polite friendly and seemed to actually care. What happened??!!",1
"Updated Mar. 17, 2022",Not a choice for music lovers,Absolute crap!! My package was supposed to be here inbetween 1.45pm 16.15 I've buy now option now it's coming at 10pm!! Ffs! I've got a delivery tomorrow and a delivery on Friday mate!!! Back to the high Street for me! And amazon prime next day delivery! Scamming robbing c#%s! That's it from me cancelling the prime right now!,1
"Mar. 16, 2022",Going Downhill Fast,"my profile asks drivers to leave packages on porch but they just can’t seem to figure it out. This day in age you would think they would make an attempt to secure the packages but instead, they leave a skinny box standing vertical so the tallest side can be seen from down the block. it’s almost like they invite people to steal it!! Also, they didn’t ring bell and forged my signature as if i signed for it! Another less than fabulous performance by someone who makes too much money to do less than the minimum. Train your staff Jeff!",1
"Mar. 16, 2022",Amazons customer service has gone so…,"another delivery today, no issues great service",1
"Mar. 16, 2022",Absolute crap!,"Amazon treats their Prime members no differently and paying for Prime membership does not give you faster delivery service. A guaranteed window of delivery is NO GUARANTEE AT ALL! Customer service reps don't care and when a customer ends a chat, the customer service rep should not be reaching out to the customer--HARASSMENT!!!",1
"Mar. 16, 2022",Delivery drivers supporting package theft,"I like to use the products searches and buy cheaper from other sites. Customer service and delivery is the best thing about amazon, prices, no.",1
"Mar. 16, 2022",another delivery today,"In a dispute with a seller regarding an item which was 'not fit for purpose', conflicting information was given by Amazon customer service (a misnomer if ever there was one), with lies being told just to get me off the phone in an attempt to placate me.  THIS TACTIC DID NOT WORK.  My advice is simple, DO NOT use Amazon.  There are other options available, TRY THEM.",5
"Mar. 16, 2022",Amazon treats their Prime members no…,Orders are always swift and returns policy is hassle free. Prime account is well worth the money.,1
"Mar. 15, 2022",I like to use the products searches and…,If you order a lot it would behoove you to have Prime. Well worth it! I get most of my items in 2-3 days! Been ordering for quite a while and S&H is free with Prime. I love this service!!!,5
"Mar. 15, 2022",Customer Service...NOW THAT'S A JOKE!!,It would be great if I could get my package from amazon locker.,1
"Mar. 15, 2022",Orders are always swift and returns…,"Lazy or incompetent delivery driver dosent know how to read!! He dumped my parcel on my nextdoor neighbours doorstep, then I got notified that my parcel had been handed to the recipient???I reckon to get a job at being an Amazon delivery driver you have to say your a liar, lazy and very incompetent and have a very much of a dont care attitude, but then all of the above come from their HO as they obviously don't care about how many parcels go missing/stolen because the drivers also can't seem to be able to read simple instructions as to where exactly to leave a parcel!!",5
"Mar. 15, 2022",I'm a happy camper!,"These TCN phone reps are the worst.They do not understand why you are calling and are always trying to pigeon hole you into some other option to get you off the phone.Additionally, their English is so heavily accented, it is nearly impossible to have a conversations as you spend so much time asking them ""What?"" or ""Please repeat that?""Just hire English speakers from one of the 5 countries:, USA, Canada, GB, Australia, New Zealand, Have the others attend Class.",5
