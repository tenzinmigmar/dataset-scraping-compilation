"April 19, 2022",The Death of Instagram,"""Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them."" so wrote the balding perfumed ruff model William Shakespeare, but alas these blustery words were not intended for the dead eyed Mark Zuckerberg, nor anyone that creates albeit legal, voyeuristic masturbatory digital snooping tools. Though hardly great, Mr.Zuckerberg and his lesser competitors have given us the likes of TikTok, MySpace and Facebook the latter spawning the slightly more idiotic Instagram. As a target audience garden variety moron myself, I took to Instagram like a Floridian does to NASCAR. So many ""friends"" I made from Trucknutz69 to DonaldTrump4prezudent; finally I was a part of a community, such that it is. However, the rot was about to set in.Having never felt the need for such security measures as double authentication, a pencil outline of my penis or a drop blood from which a match could be made to verify myself to the robots at Meta, I sat back in my superior manner and never worried once about male enhancement pill salesmen or bitcoin hucksters wanting to commandeer my Instagram feed. However, just like Mr.Zuckerberg's mother commenting on her son's terrific sense of humour, I couldn't have been more wrong. Upon returning from my miserable job as a modern day gong farmer, I sat down, very much the broken man, to see how my pal Kanye West was doing, here I discovered that my Instagram feed had been expropriated by one of aforementioned bitcoin barrow boy. No more The Rock, no more RepublicansforJesus, no more vulcanized Brazilian 19 year olds asking for a few reals to finish med school in Brasília...I was well and truly hacked. So, what solution did Instagram have for me? Instagram, the company worth 100 billion dollars- they said, and I'll paraphrase Lou Costello here: ""I dunno!"". As minutes turned into hours more and more of my followers were being drawn into this evil bitcoin scheme. And then it started, actual real people I know began to call- not Mr. The Rock nor any Brazilian med students/bikini models, but honest decent people I actually know, some of whom use Instagram for their business. Could I stop this avalanche? Well, ask anyone who this has happened to and you'll know my answer.The solution: take some of that money and hire a customer service team (like the Brazilian ""fitness"" model most likely employs) and have them standing by to field the myriad issues involving lowlife hackers usurping your innocent user's Instagram feeds. Apologize to countless users that you've allowed to dangle from a rope of your own creation and then comb out the eggs and nits of the hacker from your own greasy head. ""Meta"" is a person or thing that is more than usual or that goes above and beyond- well I'd settle for less, not less in the Instagram sense, but less in the ""just do something in a reliable manner"" sense....Instagram- you're as terrible at helping your users as you are brilliant at bringing American simpletons to international attention.",1

"April 15, 2022",Horrible,"Horrible. I'm not able to log in to my business account on my desktop. There are certain tasks that need to be completed by desktop. This company has no organized system to address issues. Instagram automated message states to enter the 4 digit code sent to my phone number ending in---- but no code is ever sent. I've had this happen before and they offer no explanation as to why this is happening. I'm dealing with an actual live person now and they asked for verification information which I provided 5 days and ago and no response. This is NOT a situation where i forgot my passcode or I have an incorrect phone number listed, it's a situation where they are NOT sending the code because their system is NOT functioning properly. I have never had such a bad experience with logging into an account. Fix your system Instagram/Facebook and If you can not do that, then you need to shut Instagram down or bring in a NEW CEO and whole new team because the people that assist you can not answer simple questions....",1

"Updated Apr. 1, 2022",It is not about friend’s pictures…,"My personal experience with instagram is this. As soon as my posts began organically generating thousands of followers and likes on a daily and sometimes hourly basis due to the factual content I was posting about the “new world order depopulation agenda”, they abruptly shut down my account! They shut down my backup account in advance prior to doing this for absolutely no reason! I was hardly using it. They shut down several accounts I had without justification, warning, or any response, resolutions, etc. They are ruthless to deal with and even though I have other old accounts on there, I’ll never trust them again or put my best content on their platform. Refer to my fakebook review below for tips on where to post freely without penalty. Who wants to deal with endless censorship? I’m on every alternative social media site now! You will never find the truth on mainstream social media sites since it’s all being banned, deleted & blocked. That’s why most people are uninformed. Use Telegram, Bitchute, Rumble, Odysee/Lbry, Yandex (to search), Protonmail, Signal messenger, MeWe, Wimkin, Minds, Gab, Parler, and get off of the “sheeple platforms”. They’re a waste of time! All of your posts, videos, friends lists, & accounts will disappear on the censored sites. Eventually, many people will wake up to the nonsense and migrate to the other sites! It’s so much more worth it to be where you can access THE TRUTH.",1
"Mar. 29, 2022",glitches & bad mod,"I do not want an Instagram account, I just want to see my friends' photos.But you keep insisting I log in or sign up ""to continue"".I have tried to do that, and found that you consider ""the IP address that [I am] using has been flagged as an open proxy. If [I] believe this to be incorrect, please visit [the help page]"".Definitely incorrect, we are just a regular home broadband IP.The help page link is a generic one, and there is no useful information there whatsoever.You have failed on three counts regarding basic functionality.  You are also causing an epidemic of mental health problems.  How can you justify working for this company?If you are looking for an alternative I would suggest Flickr (I have no affiliation).",3
"Mar. 21, 2022",Good app but too much spam!,My account got hacked 2 weeks ago. Since then I have been trying to get it back. Instagram doesn't have any proper channels where you can reach out to them and solve the issue. They have this thing where you have to send a selfie video. It doesn't even work. I have sent multiple selfie videos and they keep saying they couldn't verify me. Are you F'ing serious? I have multiple pictures on my profile which got hacked. The hacker is now harassing my friends. I have even replied to the emails I got from Instagram and they don't even reply back. fix this.,3
"Mar. 19, 2022",Instagram deactivated my account only…,"I’m having the worst experience ever because of the lack of communication you have within your team. I’ve been SHADOW BANNED for almost two months now!! You are doing this ILLEGALLY and none of my previous feedback is been heard and I never received a reply from you even all my reviews.I found your sense of community lacking from the original meaning that it has because you don’t really care about your community. You are banning my profile without having the chance for my works and content, all of this illegally and not specified in Terms and Conditions.I don’t like financing a ghost utopic community that doesn’t consider myself as part of his own community too.Is just a shame and I’m concerned.I want to close both my accounts I have with you, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp.I found both TikTok and Twitter a better and more inclusive place where I could’ve speak with a customer service and where I received a resolution too.You don’t listen, you don’t involve people of being part of your community, because you trick them! You trick your own users penalising them and without providing any kind of assistance in any issue they may find.I didn’t receive this treatment from any other social media, but if you don’t care about your community it will not be important deleting all my accounts from your platforms! NO COMMENT.",1
"Mar. 15, 2022",R3tarded app keeps blocking my OWN…,"Have you ever wondered what does Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp do with your data each time you open their application, log in to their Web services?Based in their rules and regulations, none of these services should ever trace your location, nor your IP address. In reality, this is way different and whatever you do, whichever place you log in, using whatever IP address, Marc Zuckberg’s social media is illegally spying on you and collects all data without your permission.A while ago Europe voted strict rules when it comes to GDPR and data protection of it’s citizens. Unfortunately, our data is being stored, used for their purpose without us knowing that. I myself, always use VPN services when it comes to social media or simple browsing on the net and because of that, Marc’s team not only marked my account as suspicious but also deleted it without even checking with me first.What I found even worse then the need to collect where I am every time I used their services, is first they ask your phone number to confirm it is you and after you do that they simply block/remove your account and in order to reopen that you are requested for even more personal details, see their response to my complaint about blocking my account. Below is their response, basically asking you to take a picture of yourself, including your handwriting and your hand needs to be visible. The picture needs to be well visible etc. What does Marc do with that, of course they store that and use that for resale to third parties for advertising purposes. So basically if you use face recognition feature Marc Zuckerberg gets that if you follow their requests and uses it in order to resale that for bigger income.Bedankt dat je contact met ons hebt opgenomen.

"Mar. 15, 2022",The best app ever!!!,"Literally one of the worst companies in the whole world right now. They are the nazis of the Internet and are trying to control certain narratives, only allowing lies to be told. This satanic entity needs taking down and burning to the ground",5
"Mar. 14, 2022",I love it!!!!,"Steve at Kigali Coffee, 2 Stoney St, Notts NG1 1LG Today my husband and I met with Steve at Kigali Coffee, Nottingham.  To say Steve is very knowledgeable about coffee; from bean to ground, is only the half of it.This week I treated my husband to a Wilfa Coffee Grinder and thought it would be a very good idea to see if somebody in the `business` could assist in best how to use the equipment.  The grinder was not purchased from Kigali so I was absolutely over the moon when Steve offered to show us how it worked.  He explained the workings with simplicity and went way beyond what the `Helpful Notes` in the grinder box explains.Whilst there he also explained the `washed` and `natural` bean difference; difference in grinds etcWe sat taking this all in, over two very tasty coffees.  This meeting has saved us making a few `novice` mistakes no doubt, but more importantly opened up a coffee shop that we will visit now, when in Nottingham, knowing that the service is above and beyond.  They care about how their coffee is prepared, tastes and presented.Thank you Steve / Kigali – amazing service.Wendy",5
"Mar. 12, 2022",Terrible app!!,"I like to share my pictures, as Photograph, without any obligations or without any comment just so. And then I want the feedback of my group/followers,..

"Updated Mar. 12, 2022",I do not want an Instagram account,"I signed up for my first account simply as a marketing tool for a new business i am opening, created account, went to login and my IP address was already blocked. Decided to use a VPN instead, a little inconvenient but no big deal, I was immediately locked out of the account. Now they want me to prove the account is mine with a tax return, utility bill etc in order to unlock an account I haven't managed to login into once. Very poor, not user/customer friendly, they probably don't care, I will be looking elsewhere.",1
"Mar. 11, 2022",My account got hacked 2 weeks ago,"They dont care at all about abuse, racism, bullying etc happening on their platform.

"Feb. 24, 2022",Terrible application and so addictive,"I'm using it for almost 10 years. It was a good app back then.

Now it's just a platform for influencers to promote themselves and make money.",2
"Feb. 24, 2022",They just don't care,Instagram basically encourage child abuse. I reported that my son’s account had been hacked and was being used to send porn to his young friends.  They just won’t respond.  There is no contact info.  You are just left to deal with the fall-out of their incompetence.,1
"Feb. 22, 2022",Pathetic app,"Worst experience ever with so-called customer service. My friend's account got hacked and we all trying to get in touch with customer service regarding that issue and no one even trying to look into this situation. Looks like the more followers you've got they personally selling info and sending that for hackers. Oh well, nothing comes for free, but if you DO something do that till the very end in professional manner. Personally i wish this whole platform just dies and somebody think of better / safer platform to use with REAL customer service and real problem solving professionals.",1
"Feb. 21, 2022",Absolute joke,"Simply the worst organisation I've ever come across. Disabled business account for no valid reason, after jumping through countless automated forms and emails, no response after weeks. It was an important business channel but they took it away. With absolutely zero lines of communication they don't give a damn about small businesses. They believe they're too big to warrant needing customer care, well I recommend everyone to leave instagram! Even facebook has a business support chat facility and they're much bigger than instagram. By using instagram you're fuelling an ethos of terrible customer service. DO NOT USE!",1

They are currently scamming my friends and family out of money and Instagram does absolutely nothing. There is no one to call, live chat, message NOTHING. They are too big of a company to leave users in this situation. Shame on them for not having active help help users get there accounts back. I understand hackers are not preventable, I don't understand how there is no way for them to at least close the account to stop them from taking advantage of its users.",1
"Feb. 16, 2022",unrealistic picture of lifestyles,"Hello, Metaverse scum bags, This is an honest review for all those who use your services. 1. For a start if you use any of the metaverse services in any capacity whether it be through Facebook or Instagram, your data will be collected, stored, stolen, sorted and then sold to the highest bidder. 2. If you eventually feel that this is ok, then you will install one of the many services Meta provides and you will be presented with the worst possible customer service on the planet. Even a truck stop in the middle of nowhere could provide better service and they are normally run by crazy people. 3. If you can look past the horrific customer service then you are presented with another problem. This problem is that the community guidelines that are supposed to ""keep you safe"" are completely bogus and censor anything that doesn't appeal to mainstream libtards where getting offended is apparently a crime. This makes no sense in the long run anyway because Meta is run by the biggest crook out. 4. Mark Zuccaberg. I hope you, and all your shareholders die and burn in hell because you lot are worse than the mafia. You should all be punished for your crimes against humanity behind the scenes of your clever Meta front.

Because you'll have to fend for yourself when dealing with issues on this unprofessional platform. Also, don't expect intellectual discussions that are based on freethinking here. Censorship that is dehumanizing causes that to happen. These sellouts keep promoting Instagram like it's some amazing platform. When, in reality, it's actually just a shadow of its former self. Now, it's filled with watered down content that dumbs people down with sexy girls, pets, children, babies, censorship, and other banal things.",2

"Oct. 31, 2021",Instagram is a good app but....,"Be active but not ""too"" active is apparently how commenting on posts works on Instagram. On a lazy Sunday afternoon I was spending more time than usual on Instagram, making comments, when Instagram suddenly put a stop on my commenting for three days with no explanation. There was a ""Tell us"" button but it led nowhere. After some research I read that they do this with suspected spam. Did someone not like a comment and report it? I certainly didn't write anything that broke any rules, as far as I know. Anyway, what was meant to be a photo-sharing platform is now a place of fake photos, wannabe influencers, and people with a political agenda promoting their views. Sure, there's good stuff there but it's basically just a mini-Facebook these days. I'll take my time and attention to someplace that appreciates it. :-) I deleted my account.",4
"Oct. 30, 2021",Disabled instagram account,"I’m shocked at how Instagram supports almost pure nudity. I use it for my business in the skincare industry. In fact most of my paid post of a clients before and after pictures of skin issues are declined. It’s a shame because the goal is to help others find a place for skincare treatments. Just scrolling through all sorts of post most girls I’ve seen are want to be porn stars in sexual positions. Other post I have seen are bare breast before and after pictures which I think are disgusting. It’s a shame that Instagram supports this type of nasty nonsense. This is exactly why young girls are on TV talking about the negative impact Instagram has had on their lives and confidence. Great job Instagram for supporting Trash, Nudity and Evil to this world. I’m sure your children will turn out this way since you support it. Geeze!!!!",1

I knew it was odd, because she looked beautiful and she was following 76 people and 0 people were following her.  Then she messaged me and it was some dirtysex site.  So, I deleted her and my picture.  My profile, I couldn't find where to delete, so BrianEStead is on there for now.",1

After I did a simple phone authentication it's saying approx 24 hrs to get me back to track but no msgs till now. Now I lost my contacts and my work schedule has been affected due to connections lost with partners etc.If you are not gonna do customer service, why form up a superficial site to pretend you have one, the auto-ban executed by the algorithm is so ""Intelligent"", it's definitely the sign of being in the top tier of the field right?",1

Do they think we're stupid enough not to have first checked there before calling? My issue isn't on there and that's obviously why I'm calling. And I had sent in a bunch of stuff from their so-called 'help-centre' and received no response at all. If they're gonna restrict their 'customer service' to an in-app built facility then at least be good at it. Extremely disappointing to say the least.",1

Well no, they have only conjured up the second coming of useless celebrity, excessive photoshop usage and unrealistic standards. You don’t need talent to be recognised, just look a certain way. (even if you don’t!) The app is completely filled with copy cats, wasting hours a day photoshopping their nose out of existence and over-sharing on an app with horrendous privacy concerns. I thank Instagram everyday for restricting my account and eventually deleting after I sent multiple forms to reinstate it. 5/6 years of memories lost due to incompetence, I now see it is probably worth it though as this app is the embodiment of brain damage. Not to sound like a boomer but this app has ruined a generation.",1

Years of investing time, money (Yes, I used to buy a lot from products adds in Instagram) and energy wasted because at the end they really don't care about their users experience, not even a long history of well behaviour in the app stops them from deleting your account when is not even your fault that it was hacked.

Any child who happens to accidentally misclick out of curiosity is then in full view of heavily suggestive photos. Then in their recommended friends list, they see more of those profiles. You have to then manually X out those recommendations. Instagram needs to do more to block such inappropriate content.
