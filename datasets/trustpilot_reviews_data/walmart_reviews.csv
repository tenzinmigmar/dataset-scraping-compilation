This is fine but, the last two times I have done my pickup the money was not taken out until 3 or 4 days later and the temp hold was released by then. Now account is overdrawn.

Later that day, I get email saying it was delivered. It was not.  I checked my camera and at no point did Fed Ex come to my door.  It was a lie.

Teach your staffs how to help customer's need with good manners and conduct. I noticed this kind of service most of the time at Walmart. To those three staffs today . My advice to you three, if you guys tired with your job please quit because you're stressing me out!!!",1

Then I had to sit and wait about an hour so they could call my Doctor. Then yesterday, 4/13/22, I called in my refills, 3, and they told me to come pick them up in an hour. I arrived an hour later and was told it would be another half hour. Then when I get up to the counter to get my 3 refills, there are only 2. and the girl actually tried to tell me I only had 2 refills. Finally they found their mistake and instead of filling it right then, I had to wait another half hour. The people working in this pharmacy need to be fired or retrained, they don't seem to be very good at their jobs. I will not go to a pharmacist I don't trust. I used the pharmacy at the Switzer Road Walmart in Biloxi Ms. for about 10 years before I moved, and I am going back to them even though it is out of my way.

I spend anywhere from $800 to $1,200 at the first of the month for monthly groceries. I spend more time bring customer service over four items that I am being overcharged than I do picking up all my groceries. I'm not referring to items that have been put in the wrong place. I have called corporate headquarters twice and was told I would get a call from the store manager it's been over 2 weeks. I just saw on on local media that the Walmart in Indian Trail has already been called for overcharging people. I was also told that the manager of the Walmart in Monroe North Carolina have been terminated 2 weeks ago and the assistant manager decided to go on vacation so they had a lead person handling the store. I stopped by tonight to pick up a few items and again I was overcharged. The 24 packs of Mountain Dew are one of the main items that they will overcharge you for and also Meats. I bought a cat bed that was Mark 9 97 but it would ring up 1497 customer service told me the price has gone up and I need to pay it I told him they could keep their s***. Any coupon that is a dollar or more in value is always keep down saying item not found I had to dig through my groceries to prove that I bought it and yes there it is so why won't it take my $3 coupon off of Tide. I am so sick and tired of Walmart ripping people off and evidently Walmart corporate does not give a s***.

I told you about the fraud, you did nothing, you did not check the delivery address, you let the same thing happen twice. Why have a fraud department if you do not do anything to prevent fraud!

Then all of a sudden one cashier decided to to move away as I waited it line for about 25 minutes. This was very frustrating and wasted my time and got me upset.  No apologies received but was told by the cashier who finally served me if i go anywhere now I have to wait that long.

And tipping drivers sounds offensive from European point of view - I am not here to compensate your corporate greed when you don't pay drivers fair wages or delivery commissions. I'd certainly expect more professionalism from such a massive company. What a shame. On top of that, you attempted to charge me delivery fee although I have Walmart+ and I had problems using a discount code - you chat agent couldn't help, so I had to call you. A lot of time wasted.

I bought an Oculus from Walmart store # 01298 on, April 19, 2022 at 14:13:31. On that date a young man assisted me with purchasing an Oculus Item # 081582002246 in the amount of $399. This was a new item to my understanding that had never been opened or used prior to purchase. Once the item was brought home, opened and used by us, we realized that it was in fact not new at all. There was a registered user on the device. The device had discoloration indicating that it was previously used as well. For this reason, I decided to return it to the store I originally purchased it from with the receipt. I explained the situation and asked for an exchange for an unopened, never used Oculus which is what I originally purchased. However, the clerk stated the serial number for the device in the box, did not match the serial number printed on the actual box. For this reason, she refused to refund my purchase. She was able to verify the transaction was made and the video camera footage showing the purchase of the item. I have been swindled basically and feel very upset by this. I have been a loyal customer of Walmart for many years and spend a good deal of my money there. This was a very special and expensive purchase for my son. We lost his father to cancer in August and I am a single parent who works very hard to provide for my son. I work for ministry serving children living in extreme poverty. I am a hardworking, honest and respectful woman. I expect when I purchase an item, especially from a reputable company I use frequently such as Walmart, that I will receive what I purchase. I have contacted my credit card company and Walmart Corporate. I am also filing a complaint with the BBB. I feel like this was really wrong and it is not okay to swindle people out of their hard earn money. I am not even asking for my $400 back. I just want a new Oculus, that is what I paid for.",1

I noticed later on after midnight on Feb 5th that the shipping address was the wrong address and immediately phoned Walmart to correct the address. I spoke to a young lady who was rude and obnoxious who said that she could NOT change my address per Walmart‚Äôs policy. She told me that I needed to get the order cancelled which she said she would do while I was on the phone and that I needed to re-order my items and send them to the correct address, which I did. Walmart sent me an email stating that the shipment would go out Feb 7th, so that meant there was time enough to cancel that order instead of charging me over $1,000 for (10) bed frames. On Feb 10th,  I received an email stating that (5) bed frames were sent to the address that I didn‚Äôt want them to go to and I called them immediately and told them to come and pick them up.  They told me that I needed to carry those heavy bed frames to Fed Ex or Walmart and I told them that I am not able to do that seeing that I cancelled the order and I already purchased the 5 bed frames sent to the correct address in a few days.I spoke to Representative Edward on 2-10-22 @ 12:45pm to complain that Walmart charged me (2) times for bed frames. Solution: Edward said that since I couldn‚Äôt physically bring the items into the store or Fed Ex and I didn‚Äôt have a printer to print out a return label that he would run through a transaction to get my refund within 3-5 biz days. He said that I could Dispose of bed frames or keep them since it wasn‚Äôt my fault that the original order was NOT cancelled by Marcella (or so says the email) as she instructed it would be.I waited a week and there was NO refund so I phoned Walmart back and that is when all the games begun. The horrible customer service agents hung up in my face, put me on hold when I asked to speak to a supervisor then hung up while waiting to speak to a supervisor, told me that they weren‚Äôt giving me anything because the items were delivered, laughed at my distress, and told me to call my credit card company to get my refund.  I cannot find any corporate phone numbers to inform the higher ups that they have severe problems with their customer service agents and policies. I believe Walmart has very deceptive policies and certainly horrible CS staff & practices. Looks like from thousands of reviews I read, after the fact, that many people are experiencing these terrible things and have been for years. Reviews after reviews within Walmart are simply horrifying and this company is declining every minute of the day.  I will stick with Amazon from now on and pay a higher price than to be ridiculed, gas lighted, and tormented with the games they play with their unfair practices.

Well the nightmare has not even started yet. Now you get to talk to someone in another country about the solution. They give you the ""OPTION"" of 1. Replace or Return.... That is your option and they are the same thing. It means YOU get to repackage it, YOU then get to print a label, YOU get to drive it to Fed Ex, YOU get to wait for the replacement to arrive. Well what if you do not have a printer? No problem as you can buy one from WALMART!!!Walmart is known for trying to make their problems into YOUR problems. Can you just bring it into the store & replace it? NOT AN OPTION! Can they just send the replacement part? After all it is just the ring to the turn table that is in 3 pieces. The microwave is fine. NOT AN OPTION!There is another option that they don't mention. Stick to YOUR guns. They can SEND me a new label (they will try to change your mind with more hassles) and say it will take 2 weeks. That is fine as I am printing out NOTHING! As far as me driving,,,, That is not happening either! They will send a truck here to get it. In the meantime I will go on AMAZON and get a ring for it. I will then send back their mush box, broken ring, and never buy from Walmart again. It makes no sense to order online to avoid the hassle of their insane long lines and nobody to assist you.... If you have to have a worse experience online. People can just go to a real store or Amazon and get it hassle free!!! Thank you for shopping at Walmart and have a miserable day.

Fed Ex had a new trainee delivery driver who FAKED the first two delivery attempts. These counted against me. When a third attempt was made by a real driver and my significant failed to respond to the intercom because the number dials her phone, I was given three strikes then told they won't be coming back, so I asked Walmart for a refund and they issued it. Two days later, Fed Ex suspended the signature requirement and delivered my phone, which was supposed to be well on its way back. What a keystone cop operation that was. Now I have a phone that is not activated, which I've told them I want to keep and they need to charge me for it, but I'm still in limbo.

"Updated Mar. 28, 2022",Generally a great experience but not for phones,"In November 2021 I purchase an online vaccuum cleaner, next day I got an email, that elevated up did not have this product and to buy something different, then I received another email that my vaccuum had been delivered! NOT! I called walmart, they put the money back, I bought another vacuum in store, walmart then recharged for the first vaccum, and I have been in disputes with them ever since. Capital one is currently working with me on this. They have told walmart that this dispute was won by me and to take the charge off. They have not. Plus all interest fees are on my bill. walmart is a billion dollar industry, trying to take my very hard earned money. I will never shop there again. so sorry that walmart needs $150 for a vacuum I never received, so bad.It's a sad situation and this won't make much difference to them. But it is ethically wrong to not waive this fee, when the consumer for 5 months pleads that they never received product!Sheila Carter",1
"Mar. 27, 2022",I Am writing this review to complain‚Ä¶,Canceling for 2 reasons: 1. Walmart tries to mislead you into picking up  most items from in-store. Elderly people can not understand they have to actually click a few times to un-check defaulted pick up in store.  The default should be everything you put in you cart should default to delivery or shipping. You should have to change to pick up in store if that is what you want to do.2.Automatically adding mandatory tip to you account after delivery. This is just another way Walmart tries to trick you into paying their employees even if it is door dash. Walmart needs to pay door dash or delivery person and let customer freely add on any tip they wish to give to driver. Not sure but read that the 7.00 mandatory tip (written in very light letters after the order has been placed with most customers not even seeing it) actually goes to Walmart to pay for the already paid hourly worker for pulling the items. This is just a shady dishonest way Walmart tries to scam customers out of their hard earned money. Really disgraceful.,1
"Updated Mar. 26, 2022","3402224-525254 Used defective merchandise sold as ""new"".",This review is for Walmart online - My last few orders have been impressive. The most recent one - I ordered 2-day shipping and it ended up being delivered the same day - really impressive. Email sent each time to inform about delivery.

"Mar. 10, 2022",Cmon People!!!,"Honestly don't know how I can't rate them 0 stars! Customer service is a joke. I was at the store and asked to price match and item on Walmart.com and was told by the supervisor that there could be a glitch/mistake. I can't make this up. I was then told to place the order for pick up. Mind you, I was currently at the store. I go ahead and place the pick up order and asked if I can just pick it up now. The supervisor says ""no, it may take up to 3 hours."" I go ahead and contact Walmart customer service to ask if maybe they can go ahead and either contact the supervisor at the store or speed up the pick up process because I am at the store and driving home to come back in 3 hours is such an inconvenience. Let's just day the representative that answered the phone had no idea and I mean no idea what price match and I am at the store meant. I asked to speak to a supervisor who advise Walmart stores work independently and there is nothing he can do other than assist on an online order. I repeat for the 10th time that I was told to place the order online for pickup. The supervisor of customer service says ""there's nothing I can do."" I do not understand how Walmart can have individuals with no common sense working to assist others.",1
"Mar. 9, 2022",Bad Customer Service.  Is This Walmarts Standard?,"DO NOT BUY ANY FURNITURE FROM THIS FUFU&GAGA Furniture Store. HOME DEPO SELLS THEIR FURNITURE AS A THIRD PARTY SELLER. I PURCHASED A WHILE VANITY FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. WE WERE LOVING AT MY IN LAWS WHILE WAITING FOR OUR PLACE SO WE PUT IT UP AND NEVER OPENED IT. WE JUST RECENTLY MOVED AND OPENED IT TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND THE PARTS ARE SMASHED AND DAMAGED, PARTS ARE MISSING AND THE MIRROR DOES NOT WORK. WHEN CONTACTING THE COMPANY THEY DID NOT SHOW ANY SORT OF EMPATHY FOR OUR ISSUE AND WOULD NOT REFUND US OUR MONEY AS THEY CLAIM ITS TOO OLD. THIS COMPANY HAS DONE NOTHING TO HELP US WOTH OUR ISSUE. ITS A TRASH COMPANY WHO DIRECTLY ONLY SELLS AS A THIRD PARTY SO ITS HARD FOR YOU TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK. THE QUALITY IS TERRIBLE FOR THE PRODUCTS!!",2

"Mar. 8, 2022",Deserves 0 stars,"They really need to fix the app. It's very confusing. Combining grocery delivery with shipping is causing me a headache. I put items in my grocery delivery cart, then find out that some of the items are placed in the shipping cart! Also, they don't allow you to choose substitutes. You're at the mercy of the shopper. Don't like your replacement? They make YOU go back to the store for a refund. If I wanted to go to the store, then I wouldn't have used a grocery delivery service! I think they rolled out Walmart+ too quickly. Instacart is so much simpler!!",1
"Mar. 8, 2022",DO NOT BUY ANY FURNITURE FROM THIS‚Ä¶,"So Ive been a customer for 5 yrs have purchased many expensive products from Walmart. So one day, I went to charge on 2/27 a HomePatrol-2 scanner for 480$. So they  cancelled my order in which they deemed it suspicious for whatever reason i cant ascertain. To add insult to injury my money (480$) was frozen they keep blaming my bank about not having the money refunded its now 3/7. They blame the bank and the bank blames them. Now the bank tells me the funds will be released tomorrow 3/8 and it'll be cleared for spending on the 9th 3/9 its crazy how much control this merchant has to deny my charge and then freeze it for like 10 days its unbelievable. They lost a good customer not even a call poor business practices. Wondering if other people have been through this situation. Still waiting its the 9th 3/9 ridiculous. Just got it today ordered it from amazon.",1
"Mar. 7, 2022",Horrible shipping,"is there a zero stars option? i consolidated two returns in one box -- placing the return label for one return on the outside of box and attaching the return label for the other return to corresponding items inside the box -- and now they won't refund the money for the second return. the advice i was given is to check with FedEx... but the issue is that i consolidated the returns, and NOWHERE in any of WalMart's communications does it say that returns are based on FedEx processing the shipping label (vs Wal Mart processing the return label at their fulfillment center). This is a crucial piece of information for customers... and now I'm out $127 for their lack of clarity. I've spent hours on chat and phone with customer ""care"" -- quotes here intentionally -- to no avail. I've been shopping WalMart for years and will now stop. To my mind, this says everything about WalMart's operational ethos, which is in essence, ""If anything goes wrong, even if it's our fault, we keep makin' the money... at your expense."" This would not happen at Amazon. Buyer Beware.",1
"Mar. 7, 2022",Terrible customer service,"Just shopped at one of their Neighborhood Markets. Walmart.com said the item I needed was X price (confirmed the store selected was the store I was at). When I went to the store, the item was a different price. I asked to correct the price to what was online, on their website. The person wouldn't do it, stating ""We don't price match to our website."" This is called lying (saying something is one price, then charging something different for it). Confirmed from Walmart corporate (via their number 1-800-WALMART) that that is Walmart's policy. You have been warned.",2
"Updated Mar. 7, 2022",They really need to fix the app,"They recently made updates to their website.  Now I choose ""shipping"" and when done shopping, I go to my cart, and half the items are for pick up.  When you choose shipping, they show out of stock products and make suggestions, those suggested items are not available for shipping.  Totally wonky, confusing, frustrating.  I quit shopping there after 3 horribly confusing wasted times trying to order several regular household items.  Going to Amazon.",1

I look all around my place, nothing found. Checked security camera, nothing 1 hr before after. Email said allow 2 days.  Today I called Walmart for my refund, I was told I have to contact the third party seller even though the didn't my mention that when I ordered.  I just contact them for my refund ASAP!

"Mar. 5, 2022",Won't honor online price,"Walmart Plus is getting worse and worse.  After the website update, I can no longer use pick up and delivery.  There is no way to pick a delivery date or time for pick up or delivery.  I tried my computer, pad, and phone.  It just doesn't work.So I try shipping and it is hit or miss.  Too many items aren't available for shipping or it cost 4 or five times more than the store.  I am old and can't easily lift a case of water and the store only has huge cases. I was able to order water for a while, but not anymore.  I keep getting things I didn't order in my deliveries.  Walmart hasn't wanted any back.  I have to donate or give away.Today I got someone else's order and I have to find a fed ex office in a small city without one.  Why can't they send fed ex for it?  And I have to re-order my items and hope they are still available for shipping.",1

"Mar. 3, 2022",Walmart Plus is a disaster,"Went to Walmart in Athens on Lexington Road and stood in line about 20 minutes or more to purchase a phone and the (1) associate that was there was VERY RUDE, and SNAPPY. On Tuesday 2/28/2022 about 8:30pm or so. I will not be shopping for any appliances, or phones from this store in the future. I did talk with a Manager. She listen and apologized for the bad experience and also let me know that I was not the only one that has complained about his attitude and rudeness. I don‚Äôt know if there will be any repercussions, but I hope there will be. There is no excuse for his rudeness. If there has been other complaints, why have this been allowed to continue. 1 (one) star was only because I couldn‚Äôt select 0 I didn‚Äôt complete my shopping after talking to the ‚ÄúManager‚Äù I decided not to spend 1 cent there.

"Feb. 27, 2022",Love to Stock up,The employees are worthless and refuse to help or even stop their conversations. Their online pick up is a joke - you have to go to an unmarked place and call a number which no one answers and it sends you to voicemail.

I had no idea it was to be shipped via Door dash assumed it was to be shipped via UPS or Fedex.  I had to call corporate and get an entire refund.

"Feb. 24, 2022",St. Cloud MN Walmart,"Bought a ""Herbo""  Battery and it was damaged, six months later it died, Apart from washing their hands over a compensation they didn't even ask for further information over the incident. I've done a little research and several people complain about that maker (they also say the battery lasts just 6 months).  But Walmart won't take action at all and will keep on selling faulty batteries to their customers. A responsible company would inquire their customer about the facts and audit their stock to corroborate the fraud on part of their provider. They have an experience section but they won't accept a ticket that is six months old. A battery lasts at least 2 years. So how would they know if their customers are not being scammed?",1
"Feb. 23, 2022",The employees are worthless and refuse‚Ä¶,Walmart needs to have larger bags for things like paper towels and toilet paper. Years ago stores used different colors of tape that the cashier put on large items. I am tired of feeling like a criminal at the door. I will no longer shop at the super center. I will buy large items and clothes somewhere else. I haven‚Äôt bought dog food from Walmart for over 2 years for this same reason. You are losing business - word of mouth is a great thing.,1
