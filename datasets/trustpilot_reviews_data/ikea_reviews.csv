"April 19, 2022",Zlatan approves.,"Have discovered the new ""Buy Back"" scheme they have introduced without honestly informing their customers.  Bought walk in wardrobe shelving compilation 29 January and was delayed in install until 04 April due to builder delay in completion.  When I return a small part of the multi buy items they told me I had used it.  It was only partially assembled with no inner shelves as it became clear at that point it would not fit.  But they insisted I had ""used"" it and only paid me 40% of its value as a buy back.  So the 365 return policy no longer exists really- No signs advising - really atrocious behaviour of staff on the day when I queried it.  I could take it back if I did not like it.  Wrote to manager of store and did not even get a response.  Buyers beware - policy change with no fair notification.",5
"April 19, 2022",Buy back rip off from IKEA dublin instead of fair return,To all Muslims Sweden the nazist country is continuing to kidnap our children and continuing to protect Quran burners . Please boycott ikea and H&M boycott any Swedish product.,1
A day ago,To all Muslims Sweden the nazist…,"I had bought a new office chair which did not fit in the area where I was using it, but to my shock they refused to return when the chair was in brand-new condition. Add taken to the store in Lakeside, the staff member Amariah was very rude and claimed I had “used” the chair which is totally false. It is in new condition and yet we are acting nasty, this was not how the service was a few years ago and they have really gone downhill. The service has gotten really poor and I would advise anyone to consider purchasing from here not to do so. I have made a complaint to their HEAD OFFICE and CEO.",1
"April 14, 2022",Brand-new item returned refused shambolic service,"Just wanted to give a shout out to the IKEA Philippines delivery team that made it possible for us to enjoy one of IKEA's sofas in a timely manner. We had a late request on a delivery and while it wasn't within IKEA's policy to do so, the team looked at options and choose an alternate way to make the delivery of the sofa happen.So - a BIG thanks to Ms. Alma (EB Manager) and her team Michael and Phil who went into action. THAT is what you call ""thinking outside the box"" and providing exceptional  IKEA customer service.",1
"April 12, 2022",IKEA Philippines delivery team!!!,"I would have not given it any stars but as you have to it has one star. The worst service I’ve had the unfortunate pleasure to receive. I have tried fifteen times to register with them to receive a discount on an item of furniture I wished to purchase, yes, fifteen times. Their system does not allow potential customers to purchase items online. So I decided to ring them, but before I found out their telephone number I used their online chat, again circles and not very bright people. I then used their customer service query search. Did not recognise my query, which I reworded numerous times but it just was not recognised. When I eventually found their number, and got through to a human the only things they could say was “no worries”. I was then out through to the resolution centre who also liked the phrase “no worries”. We’re I was informed that a ticket needed to be raised as the I.T. Department were unaware of this problem. I had already explained that I had been on a forum with hundreds of people experiencing the same issues as me and this went back to March 2020. So if IKEA are unaware of this issue and after two years still not doing anything to resolve it then I’ll take my custom elsewhere.",4
"Apr. 12, 2022",None existent customer service.,"I recently purchased online a sit/stand active support and paid for delivery using the local postal service CTT in Portugal, who lost my package and three weeks later IKEA Portugal has not refunded me. They say that I have to wait until CTT responds to their inquiry. So, one week ago I called and they said that CTT located the package and will be returned to ikea, and only when it is received in the store that they will refund me. I found out today that the whole thing is a lie, CTT never responded and never located the item, and ikea still insists that I should wait until the item is returned to them, an item that never received. The whole process is a joke, the package obviously will never be found but they continue on insisting that I should wait. I never received the package, so I should get my money back no matter what, right? Wrong!!! That’s not how IKEA works.. disappointing and shocking the lies that they gave me.",1
"Apr. 11, 2022",Bad customer service,"A couple of years ago in the midst of the pandemic I bought stuff for my mom which I had to return as she passed away before she could ever use it. I tried to return it - within the year. As I had many other estate issues going on and only was in in Germany for a few weeks it turned out the time IKEA required was not enough time-so I had to gift it to somebody instead of returning - 700Euros lost. I swore I’d never buy from these people again. Sadly, I did not follow my own advise  and bought something from IKEA again. 50% success-in a way. I received two out of four ordered items. The other two were never delivered. AND of the 4 packages delivered two were not mine and I was just told to donate/trash them. Talking about IKEA saving the environment!!!",1
"Apr. 10, 2022",A couple of years ago in the midst of…,Went to the store in greenwich and got great service from a salesman in his 70s sorry forgot his name but fantastic service and very helpful . ordered a mattress. They delivered it on time but left it in the hall so the deliver to room promise not so good hence 4 stars,2
"Apr. 10, 2022",Great service in greenwich,"Beware of the delivery claim on their website to deliver to the room of your choice if you're buying a bed or mattress. Chances are you'll stump up £40 for delivery only for the delivery contractors to be unable to get the item up your stairs or refuse to touch the item if you offer to unwrap it so that it can then be manoeuvred upstairs. I was left with trying to lug a heavy kingsize mattress upstairs on my own, which I did, but I'll use a local company rather than Ikea next time. no response to my feedback email either. The mattress was ok and as described.",4
"Updated Apr. 8, 2022",Be wary of their delivery claims.,"I bought a small drawer. And to be honest, it was easy to assemble. The only thing I don't like is the quality of the product. It could be a bit better. Apart from that fast delivery.",3
"Apr. 7, 2022",I bought a small drawer,"I bought the table, and, of course it came damaged. They want me to dismantle it and send them back. I have mounted it for hours... They do not want to send a damaged piece! Never again! Very bad quality and unprofessional customer care.",4
"Apr. 6, 2022",I bought the table,Horrible customer service. Actually chalk it up to no customer service. They delivered wrong product on a day that was after my scheduled date. Arranged a pick up 3 times all three times no show. I’m the meantime I can’t get refunded till they pick up the mistake they caused. They have the nerve to always say this is being recorded when all these mistakes are being made from them. Incompetent unprofessional and no accountability. The worst experience ever. Still have the product at home and on deliver pick up on another day which they won’t call or show up again. I’ll never buy a single thing there ever again. The frustration is not worth there I don’t care attitude. Awful I’d give them a zero if they allowed to give them a rating below 1. Never again,1
"Apr. 3, 2022",Horrible customer service,"chokingly bad. As having worked in customer care my self for >5 years, I know what to expect. I understand they might be busy but they take time writing elaborating, insulting messages instead of just listening to my concern. and no way to give feedback on this (talking about fb messenger). Incredible, this ruined my day.",1
"Apr. 3, 2022",chokingly bad,"Ikea has a terrible website along with a terrible customer service. The product that I wanted, I was waiting for a very long time. Now that it was available I wanted to place the order, however the ikea website says it’s available for delivery and not in stock at a current store for pick up, or it says it’s available for delivery and for pick up. So I place the item in my cart and then the item says not available for delivery or pick up? Is it the ikea website ? Because it is really unhelpful. And what exactly is customer service here for? They can’t help with anything other than say “ it is what the website says “ . This is confusing to me (the customer) . Please fix this situation because this is a waste of time!",1
"Apr. 2, 2022",Ikea has a terrible website along with…,"Avoid! You get better customer service from drug dealers! Booked 2 deliveries and still nothing has appeared. Phoned today and after an hour of listening to ABBA finally managed to get through to a human being. Did the security check and gave my order number and he told me exactly what my order was etc and then put me on hold for nearly 20 mins to then come back and tell me the old chestnut that the systems were down and they couldn’t do anything, even though he’d just told me what my order was which I mentioned and he became rude. Basically fobbed off and told to phone back tomorrow which I will - to cancel it. £500 out of pocket and nothing to show for it & I have to chase them up wasting hours on the phone because they don’t have the courtesy to even give an explanation or let you know what’s going on!

"Updated Apr. 1, 2022",Avoid,"Wouldn’t give them one star as it’s too generous. Absolute robbery. Items never delivered, same excuse always given. No correspondence regarding delivery, people in waiting on it wasting the whole day for a delivery that will never appear.

Appalling customer service it’s almost criminal how they can take £100s sometimes £1000s of peoples money and leave them hanging and refuse to refund!!",1
"Apr. 1, 2022",Wouldn’t give them one star as it’s too…,Very bad customer service by Nisha. She called and said 2 of my items that I purchased are out of stock and they will process a refund. But they were in stock when I ordered them and while creating the order it was not explained. She said I can reorder it and it’s possible it will be here next week and said I was not listening and I’m talking over her. Horrible  service and I will never again place an order with them as every thing was placed in order and they did not set it aside for delivery and if any other customer buys it time frame they will sell it even if an order for the same item was made,1

After sending a technician to examine the problem we were offered a new mattress or a full refund. It was delivered this morning and carried upstairs for us. We were extremely pleased and cannot fault their service. Everyone we dealt with at Ikea could not have been more helpful.,4

"Mar. 25, 2022",We bought an Ikea mattress 5 yrs ago,"I wish I could give zero stars to their delivery service. I ordered from IKEA 3 times within 2 weeks. Because I work nights, I always choose their second delivery window (2pm-9pm). First time they called me at 12. I didn´t pick up, and they showed up at 12:30. I looked at his delivery instructions and it said 14-21. He didn´t care. The next one called me at 1 pm. I picked up thinking he wanted to confirm the appointment between 2 and 9. No! He said he´s 5 minutes from my place so he wanted to come right now. I was in the middle of a meeting, so I declined. I said I would only accept the delivery after 2 pm. The last one, today, came at 10:30!!! I had just gone to sleep a few hours earlier and had no idea what time it was. I asked him whether it was already 2 pm and he answered that he called half an hour ago (?!? why would he call me at 10 am, if my delivery is for 2pm at the earliest). I said that I booked the delivery between 2 and 9 pm and that this is not OK. He said (in German) ""Either you take this now, or I´m sending this back to where it came from."" Given no choice I said that since he already woke me up, he can also bring it upstairs now, but he took the delivery and walked away. His colleague was puzzled by this behaviour as well, but he just shrugged his shoulders and they left. Needles to say, I had to call IKEA service to learn that my delivery booked between 2 and 9 pm will not come today at all. This is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service. These people do as they please, abuse your phone number calling you at whatever time they want and deliver goods whenever they want. AVOID at all costs. It´s better to rent a car or van and do it yourself than to be subject to this kind of abuse.",5

"Mar. 25, 2022",I wish I could give zero stars,"I booked a removal of my old couch when I bought a new couch from IKEA. They told me, that this would happen the same time as my new one will be delivered. The new one got delivered but the guys didn’t take the old one with them, because there was no space in their vehicle, so I called IKEA and they told me to wait a couple more hours - because maybe someone will come to pick up the couch. Nobody did! So I called again and they told me (at 5pm - the new couch was delivered at 10:30am) that it won’t be picked up today and that I should arrange a new date. So I did. And today I waited 3hours… and again nobody came to pick up the couch! This is super inconvenient and a level of terrible professionalism I would have never expected from IKEA!! Huge disappointment! Need to add - the bill for the removal had to be paid up front..",1
"Mar. 25, 2022",Worst company ever,"I tried to return two items which I purchased online. The free service they offer is Collect+ where you take back your items to a designated nearby independent store. So far so straightforward. Except that the email containing the vital Q code never arrived in my inbox, even though I went through the process 3 times. I eventually rang customer services at IKEA who told me that this service is run by Yodel and I would need to ring Collect+ myself to sort it out! Not at all happy that IKEA is not taking responsibility for this, particularly as this is something that is an integrated part of the returns page on their website (not a separate page attributable to Yodel). When I suggested they might like to collect the items from my home, they told me that this would cost me £25 because the items were not faulty!",1
"Mar. 24, 2022",Super unreliable and a terrible customer service!,"Ikea has been out of stock of their kitchen cabinets, drawers, etc., for over two years. I have had to make five orders with $149 each in order to get 75% of what is needed. I get that covid has impacted supplies, but it's been over two years now. I have made orders within a day of each other and Ikea refuses to combine orders or refund any amount shipping. They wouldn't even give store credit. So disappointed in their customer service.

I had paid for the measuring service to do a measure of my kitchen, they forwarded the measurements to Ikea and I made appt with kitchen planner.  We planned new kitchen, I paid for it and it was delivered several weeks later.The installer started to install it and discovered that none of the measurements were correct.  The instore (Portland oregon) kitchen designer had put in the wrong numbers and we designed it around these incorrect numbers.  There was no support from any Ikea staff after this happened.  I went to the store and waited for an hour to sit down with another planner to plan a new kitchen.  I paid for another kitchen (I had a house full of the wrong cabinets etc and had to hire a truck to take these back so i could get a refund).  I did not trust Ikea to pick them up and give me the correct refund.Installer came back...still missing pieces, cupboard doors, drawers for most of the cabinets etc and I had given them exact measurements for my farm house sink and they had sent wrong sink cabinet doors so there was no way the sink would fit.I went back to Ikea with pictures of installers measurements as to what I still needed.  Installer came back and when we opened up the new boxes, they were of the wrong style and wrong colour.Please don't ever order from them, go to Parr Lumber where you might spend a little bit more for a semi-custom kitchen.  No one ever took responsibility for this total mix upl",1

"Mar. 19, 2022",Useless Delivery fees!!!!!!,"Just ordered £500+ of furniture from ikea including 2 chairs which were showing as available for online delivery. On payment a message popped up saying only 1 chair available. Annoyed but went ahead with the order - delivery charge of £40. Checked online 2 mins after placing the order, and to my surprise, chairs again showing as available for delivery. So I phoned ikea asking for a 2nd chair to be added to my initial order. After being passed around, I was told stocks were low so it's a ""1 chair per order"" policy - but that I could indeed order a 2nd chair which would be delivered separately for an additional £40 delivery cost to me. I pointed out how crazy this would be as it would double the delivery footprint as well as doubling the cost of the chair (£45), but despite the customer service person talking to a supervisor, the advice remained the only way to obtain 2 chairs was to make a double order! To add insult to injury, as I felt disgusted by the whole discussion, I asked for the entire order to be cancelled, only to be told I'd have to wait 10 to 14 days to receive my money :-(",1
"Mar. 18, 2022",0 out of 5 stars,"So far Ikea has failed at the following;- all items were in stock at time of order (I remember this because the things that were not in stock I removed from the order).- they failed to deliver my order on the 5th March because Ikea had sold part of our order which had already been paid for.- they then failed to contact us to let us know there was going to be no delivery. - after all that hassle, the out of stock items were split from the order and the “in stock” items were set to be delivered on 8th March. I was told I had to call back to arrange the delivery of the out of stock items. (Great service!)- 8th March I phoned Ikea after you failed to give me my 4 hour time slot. I was told “your 4 hour window is 09:30 until 13:30” At 14:00 when guess what? Ikea failed to deliver again. I called again to be told…. I can’t help you can you call back in an hour???? (Really???) so at 15:00 I called back to be told “part of your order is out of stock (a different part) so it has not been picked to be delivered” so failed delivery and again no contact!At this point I am losing the will to live so I request a refund and I point out that the order has been split, so that’s £749 in total which is £449 for current delivery and £300 for the out of stock doors. - we get one email saying £449 is being refunded. I call back and ask for confirmation that the £300 is also getting refunded. That apparently can’t be done?? I tell them I am concerned that the £300 is not going to get refunded and I’m told it definitely will. - guess what? £449 has been refunded and not the £300…. I call AGAIN On the 10th to explain my concern had happened and they haven’t done as they said. Im told it was stuck and has now been pushed through….. we are still waiting and it’s now 17th so I have very little confidence that Ikea have done this. I have requested a managers contact information 5 times and been denied. Which is fair enough, however Ikea team members clearly are not “equipped to resolve my complaint” as it’s now 9 days later, it’s not resolved and Ikea still owe us £300.Which we have just been informed is still not authorised despite being told it was “pushed through” a week ago!",1
"Mar. 18, 2022",IKEA double carbon footprint & double price policy!,£40 for delivery and yet still provides a p-poor service.The delivery guys spent more than 10 minutes outside my house routing around in the van trying to find everything from my order and yet still when I unpacked items were missing.This is the same as last time. Where as well as missing items I also had other items meant for other people.Ikea customer service absolve themselves of responsibility saying it is the delivery company side-stepping the fact that it is Ikea their customers are buying from and paying. Until they change that attitude (or their fulfilment partner) you're going to see very little improvement.Make the delivery guys wait whilst you check you have everything before you sign for delivery is my recommendation.,1

A simple task but done with care and kindness towards the customer and I don't want that to go unnoticed.

I would hate to honk how many people are being ripped off If that’s what you train your managers or your company’s way of working with people IKEA really needs to get the morales right I work in customer service and would be reprimanded if I had that tone and attitude just down right rude, unhelpful basically told it’s my fault.

Oh and a carpet cleaning session, thanks to the young deliver person trailing mud all the way through my home.This company was in such a rush, they didnt check the paperwork or delivery address, Im in Sheffield but the chairs delivered were clearly labelled to be delivered to Halifax. They just looked at me gone out when i said this isnt my order. This did get rectified but wasnt delivered to the room of choice as stipulated in the delivery info, just about got the mud off my light coloured carpet! This doesn't make Ikea immune because at the end of the day they're the ones who contract out to these. Think my complaint has been put under one of the many rugs ikea sell in store.

We didn’t mind this and so waited for the product. The day comes by (Friday) and we are told that the delivery will be made by their contractor ANC between 7am and 7pm. We received a message at 7pm saying it will be delivered in 40min. Two hours later and failed delivery. We then were asked to call ANC ourselves by IKEA and spent over 2 hours speaking with different people with no possibility to escalate. We received a call saying that Sunday would be possible for delivery and when we told them that Sunday’s don’t work, proceeded to say that the next available would be the following Sunday, we again told them Sundays don’t work and asked for a call from (ANC). Saturday no call or notification. Sunday we received a text at  9:41am saying our delivery will be made at 12-4pm (we can’t do Sundays). We organized our parents to be there at the last minute and arrived at 12:01pm. We had no access to our phones for a while and received a flurry of missed calls saying we missed our drop off. After calling the driver he said he arrived at 11:30am. After calling Ikea to share our experience there was nothing they were willing to do to resolve their (IKEA) and their contractors (ANC) incompetence. The best they could do is rebook for another Sunday 3 weeks down the line and charge us an extra delivery fee. After an hour on the phone they would only budge on the delivery fee and would not escalate the issue to any manger. We offered and asked other solutions of using other freight companies or Uber which they refused to acknowledge. Unfortunately when we hinted at a refund, they were only too obliging and was resolved in 2 min.

Flat pack.We built the unit according to the instructions, which certainly weren't as clear as some of the other instructions I have followed when constructing previous units. We persevered. It took hours.Once built, we stood back to admire the finished product. Crooked, misaligned, wobbly.We returned to IKEA to ask for guidance. We were told by one of the people who build the units that we could bring the unit back and if they couldn't fix it, we would get a full refund.We brought the unit back to 'Customer Service'. Unfortunately, the customer service department were not too understanding. Straight away they informed us that they would NOT refund us as the unit was already built. They said they would try and realign it for us.We returned after an hour to find the unit sitting in the customer service area. Less misaligned but still ... misaligned.I pointed out that the unit wasn't fit for purpose as it was so crooked. I was told that I need to take it home and 'keep adjusting it until it lined up'. I pointed out that I had already spent hours trying to do just that.They stood firm and said there was nothing more they could do - they were NOT providing any refund.They offered a service whereby I could have someone come and realign it at my home - at an additional cost. This came with no guarantee that this was even achievable.What I want to know is why doesn't IKEA clearly give a WARNING on the front page of all instructions that once assembled, the item CANNOT be returned, even if it is malfunctioning. I was under the impression that the law in the UK was that you are entitled to a refund if something is not working / broken...I had to walk away with the malfunctioning unit.I was shocked at their coldness and determination not to even consider a refund or good will gesture of any kind.

"Feb. 20, 2022",Customer service doesn’t exist,"Ordered online, Takes 16 days for a delivery date. Notified me of the delivery date and time.Failed to deliver after waiting 3 days. contacted IKEA every day. Was promised £20 compensation but that was not followed up and next operator denied that this was the case. Then Ikea needs a fortnight to refund me. So no goods and Ikea keeps your  money for a month. First and last time to order online from IKEA for me.BE WARNED",1
"Feb. 19, 2022",My sister who has autism  anxiety and…,We bought a large PLATSA wardrobe and it's a disaster. All units are wider than advertised and a lot of elements are damaged. Their customer service is the worst. We've been trying to resolve it for a month and they keep asking us the same things and I feel like we are going nowhere with this. Do not recommend buying large items from ikea.,1
"Feb. 19, 2022",5 stars to Patrick in the matras/bed department of Ikea Amersfoort,Very happy with the LED lights I bought from IKEA Glasgow. They were easy to install and worked as expected. Big shout out to Eliza who works at the lighting department who assisted me. She knows her stuff and went out of her way to find the best solution for my needs. A real asset to the company!,5
"Feb. 19, 2022",Ordered online fails to deliver,"I ordered an item that was supposed to get delivered at certain location and it never got there. Trying to contact them was impossible almost because they close super early for phone calls. Couldn’t get my stuff, got back home wrote an email, never got an answer. Few days later i just received an automatic mail saying my order had been “failed to be delivered”. Today i checked my back account to see if i have gotten any money back and nope nothing. Therefore tried calling them again this morning and never got actually to talk to anybody before their closing time. This is the third time that i “buy” something at ikea and i have this kind of experiences. It’s really not worth it. Just stole my money",1
"Feb. 19, 2022",awful experience,"Very disappointed with my Ikea experience.   Planned on completing a kitchen renovation using their Sektion cabinets.  All cabinets, doors and accessories were ordered on December 3, 2021.  Most of the items were delivered with the following 2 weeks.  Unfortunately,  5 cabinet frames were out of stock.  I understand there is a global supply issue right now, bit it's very frustrating when you call Ikea customer service time and time again and they can provide NO information at all regarding the availability of the out of stock items.  This is 2022.  I cannot believe that a worldwide company like Ikea does not have a better production  and inventory management system.  So after 11 weeks, everything  was returned to Ikea.  This whole dreadful experience has cost ne a couple of hundred dollars from the initial shipping charges to renting a truck to return everything.  If you do order a kitchen from Ikea, before committing,  make sure all the required cabinets are in stock at that time.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.",1
"Feb. 18, 2022",Thumbs up for your lighting department!,I am a 20 year technician in plumbing. I have installed all types of faucets and drains in my life but this product is sub par at best . And even using there products and cutting the pipe as close as I could to the wall and finally getting this junk together now the drawers on the stupid vanity will not shut all the way . These people should have stopped making furniture when there dressers where falling on children and killing them cause it's the same junk as before just you screw it to the wall now ....LOL. if I was the customer I am installing this for I would send it all back . BUT BEWARE IF THIS IS THE PRODUCT YOU BUY I WILL AND MOST PLUMBERS WILL CHARGE YOU DOUBLE TO WORK WITH OR ON THIS JUNK .....😜,5
"Feb. 18, 2022",Thiefs,"Its all gone .... upThe design process was great in December. We were told to order in Jan as all product would be available. In Jan not everything was available. But the delivery will be in 4 weeks. The delivery never happened. There was ""slippery mud"" on the road (Not heard that one before). In Jan I was advised to order the missing lines in Feb. In Feb, not all lines are available. We are not at the end yet, but, I struggle with the click and collect, it is not always available. By the end of it, I will have been to Reading, Milton Keynes twice and Wembley. One failed delivery. And on the phone for 4 days!!It is just endless. Oh yes. some prices have gone up by 100% since the quote! (£1400 becomes £1700...be warned) Some advisers are brilliant and will do their best for you, others can't string a sentence together.

"Feb. 18, 2022",Use to deliver fast but not this time,"I bought in IKEA in Aarhus in denmark bed and reæated items. I did it online and IKEA took 5097 dkk to a side so after delivery they would take the money from my account. That was done 22.01 this year. On the 08.02 IKEA took the money from my account but somehow the money they put to side on the 22.01. Are still to the side so even though IKEA only received 5097 dkk. I lost double that amount. And now they give me hard time getting my money back  so my account is more than 4000 dkk in minus due to their mistake and I don't hear from them. Thumps up for IKEA, or  not. 😡",3
"Feb. 18, 2022",Very disappointed with my Ikea…,"Truly, you get what you pay for with IKEA. Low cost to buy - but from then on, it's awful start to finish.

"Feb. 16, 2022",I am a 20 year technician in plumbing,"My story:I was in one of Ikea stores in Montréal , I asked for a piece of furniture ,they give me the wrong box that doesn't represent the one I choose (different color)  ,so I get the wrong color, when I arrive home I discovered that. Ssense nothing written on the box no dimension no color just blank  box, I return to the store I wait in line 40 minutes (because of covid passport )in the cold weather of Canada, and once my turn come the store close ,So I came back next day same thing happen and everybody is frustrated  customers..and employees.. very bad ambience for shopping , the item I'm returning is on promotion for $20,i only asked the  employees to only change it or give me the right color because they give me the wrong box they refuse because I lost the small bill of $20 and the box is still new I didn't even open it, I explained  the situation to the manager: is not my fault they give me the wrong box and I tell them I don't need money back ,I just want to change only the color they insult me they treating me like nobody they call security, they are arrogant very bad so I left the piece of furniture in the store and I left, I call customer service they don't care they say no invoice no change no return.. that's it..  it's not my fault the box is a new I did not open it.  They give me the wrong box and I went to the store two time was a special vehicle ,they don't care!! . Bad service arrogant attitude.So I lost this piece of furniture and  lost my 2 days of work, that's not including the van that I use especially for this big furniture.

"Feb. 14, 2022",I bought in IKEA in Aarhus in denmark…,"Slowest delivery probably in history!We ordered a bunch of small stuff February 1st. There is an Ikea less than 15 km away, but they are telling us that the order will be there the 17th. I’ve never experienced anything like that. I ordered at Amazon and though we don’t have Amazon in Denmark and I therefore needed to order from the UK site. Ordered the 8th and it will be here the 14th from UK. We won’t be sopping at IKEA anymore, this is ridiculous.",1
"Feb. 14, 2022",Cheap = awful,"I have an IKEA store credit card. I go to pay my bill on the due date, and there is a giant banner, stating they now have a 4pm deadline.... starting 2 weeks ago. Of course, everyone who sits down after work to pay their bill on their due date this month is going to be charged a late fee, and worse, an increased interest rate. What a sleezy, underhanded trick. Could you imagine playing a board game with the likes of these people? Rule change! I called and was able to have the late fee removed ""as a courtesy"", but that won't help the interest rate, which is clearly the intent. An ethical company would have given it's customers a 60 day notice for the 4pm deadline, so customers would see the change coming when they pay their bill the proceeding month. The fact that they didn't tells you the late fees and higher interest rates certainly are not an unintended consequence. They knew exactly what would happen. Ain't they slick. By the way, I have other credit cards that utilize the same bank, that don't have a time cut-off, so it absolutely is Ikea. I will never put another dime on their store card.",1
"Feb. 12, 2022",My story:,"My experience with IKEA has been a sham from the start unfortunately. I have asked for my case to be escalated multiple times, only to find that you do not offer any kind of genuine customer journey. Instead you provide road blocks. As such I have now begun proceedings for small claims court and reported ikea to trading standards and the ombudsman which I’m currently waiting for an outcome. My journey started online with the Pax system designer only to find that your layouts default the size without warning and increased the car is size of the wardrobes to “239” which would not fit. You proceeded to deliver the wrong size and refused to cancel the second delivery even after I informed you of the problem. Unfortunately this was the beginning of my problems and though very courteous and I would like to stress very friendly and diligent, your customer service is horrifically under trained, disjointed and hopeless. They have no concept of how to resolve a complaint nor do they seem to understand your own systems with any competency. They arranged for a collection to take place (this was on the Sunday 30th) on the Friday from the Manchester store while they dropped off 2 new wardrobe carcasses from the same store as it wasn’t available from distribution. A delivery of more incorrect wardrobes took place on the Wednesday that you couldn’t cancel (not dispatched so how you can’t cancel baffles me). On the Thursday you delivered the first section of replacement wardrobes (I now had 8 wardrobes and 7 does plus internal scattered upstairs making it very difficult for us to move around and my pregnant partner had to climb over boxes). When delivered we realised you had now delivered the wrong depth of the wardrobe making the internals you had delivered useless not to mention still not what we ordered / wanted.Friday came and you had cancelled the delivery dues to stock but your CS staff told us the collection would continue (if did not as it was cancelled) When the weekend rolls round another complaint raised as I need the wardrobes out of my house and I have now discovered that most of what we had been sold online was actually discontinued back in October 2021. Baring in mind we have placed our order in late January 2022 I’m shocked this is a slick pant process. Past all the new complaints and subsequently finishing your CS to be polite yet in affective both in store and on the phone we have decided we can no longer try to find a resolution and make the wardrobes you deliver work (the second deeper set) we ask for all of the unit to be collected. Your drivers come out onTuesday, to our bemusement it is booked on two aerate collection on the same day…? This is where honestly I can’t forgive nor excuse the actions or issue with  try stock, the first set of driver arrive around 11:30am they inform me heavily pregnant partner they will not collect the boxes from the top of our stairs (straight 13 steps to the front door, no turns and where you placed the units and had collected them from perviously) my partner asks what they expect her to do about it as she is pregnant to only be told it’s not their problem and she best figure it out and bring them down the stairs. So fortunate for ourselves we had carpet fitters in our house on the same day that intervened and brought the stock they were willing to take out of the house. Too the credit of your second set of drivers later in the day they could not of been more apologetic and couldn’t understand the previous drivers comments or what two collections had been booked but collected the ray of the items. Though this has been a long journey already we aren’t finished yet, since the multiple calls as your staff don’t understand where £195 has gone between all the refunds, swap etc. we have still to receive a refund and though we once again have called tonight to try and resolve it so we can go into a store to try and sort wardrobes we are left without the fund that should of been returned to be able to do so. Only to top it off that this evening we were hung up and have received no email to update us in the situation after I sat on hold for 30 minutes, during my 18th call to yourselves totalling 13 hours in the last 2 weeks trying to fix your mess. Please respond and resolve your utterly abysmal service and business practices",1
"Feb. 12, 2022",Poor quality control on the Havsta TV…,"I’ve fitted three previous IKEA kitchens but never, never, never again.  My worktop was “fitted” in early November but the hob cut out was wrong.  The contractors have admitted that it is wrong but as of today - 10th Feb - it hasn’t been corrected so my kitchen is unfinished.  Customer service is non existent - calls and emails are ignored.  They have my money so they don’t care.  This is a shockingly awful company.",2

"Feb. 12, 2022",Store card $uckery,"Where do I begin with this disgusting location. It’s a sick house of lies and deviant behavior. The manager Chris hires sexual deviants that manage the returns department. AL, the returns shift leader, has intercourse with the employees even though he is married and has a child. When Al was young he ran away from home and his parents considered him dead, threw away his belongings, and gave him a casket and head stone. His child isn’t really his, although he continues to take care of it while his “wife” sleeps with other people in front of him. That’s the kind of employees that are hired and the lifestyle that’s encouraged at this location. Save your friends, save your family, and stay away from this terrible ikea location that destroys lives and promotes discourse. I encourage you to never come back here again - Chris should be ashamed of himself for how he’s managed this location.",1

Half the items never arrived, over six hours on call waiting trying to get missing items re-ordered. I finally got the items re-ordered but still some never appeared, to then be told there is no record of me ever re-ordering them. Endless assurances that the kitchen department will call you back (they never ever call back), and you can never speak to a manager.

"Feb. 8, 2022",Where do I begin with this disgusting…,I took a display item to check since it was the last one. The lady at self checkout wouldn’t let me purchase it since it was a display…. I don’t understand why not?  What are they going to do with it? Display it again so someone else comes up to buy it?….There were many items that I saw on the floor that were display only but no items to purchase… why even have them on the floor if you won’t let customers buy them?!I’ve worked in customer service for many years and have always sold the display if a customer wanted it especially if it was the last one in the store. Think about all the let over products as a company you would collect if you never sell the display items…. That is just insane!!!,1
"Feb. 8, 2022","Poor communication, lost order, bad service",New process where you buy in store then go to an off site collection point is very poor. Been sat here for 30 mins now waiting.

"Feb. 7, 2022",I would not wish buying a kitchen from Ikea on my worst enemy,"Ordered a daybed and mattress for delivery. 7am on a Sunday morning there was banging at the door with the delivery. By the time we got down the stairs the driver had dumped the boxes in the street and driven off. Not even left a delivery note. Half the boxes for the bed didn’t arrive - 2 out of 3 boxes. Rang customer services immediately. Very helpful lady, got onto delivery team and assured us they would call back before lunchtime after speaking with the van driver to see if they have the other parts. This NEVER happened. They didn’t even bother to speak with the driver. Clearly they just never bothered to put the rest of the boxes on the van. We rang customer services back AGAIN at 3pm to enquire and that’s when we were told no idea where the rest of the goods are, no idea when it can be re delivered etc. requested a full refund and collection of the delivered boxes. Customer service agent specifically asked if we would like a morning or afternoon collection or our day of choosing. We specified afternoon. They came in the morning anyway! I’ve bought from IKEA for over 10 years and have never had a bad experience but this has put me off shopping online with them ever again. Whilst the customer service agents were helpful, they couldn’t tell me where the goods were or when I would get them. This really is not good enough when I’ve paid almost £400 and £40 for the delivery on top. I’m now £400 out of pocket, with no bed, and having to wait for a refund which will also take god knows how long!",1

The cooker started turning itself off mid-cooking after a couple of years but we have a 5-year guarantee, they’ll fix or replace it and everything will be ok, right? WRONG!Firstly, the guarantee covers fixing it and NOT replacing it. Hotpoint will keep fixing it until your guarantee period runs out and then you will be left with a dud cooker that you have to keep paying to repair. In the meantime you will spend hours at home waiting for them to fix it...again (see below)Secondly, Hotpoint engineers are a nightmare to deal with. They don’t understand the cooker they are fixing. I was told the cooker was ‘just cooling itself down a bit’ when it was actually cool enough for me to put my hand on the inside of the oven. They order the wrong parts. One engineer didn’t turn up because he couldn’t find any parking and actually wrote that down as a reason for closing the repair case! They are an absolute joke! The cooker was not even that good to begin with, even when it was working - it cooks more on one side and is not very powerful.I will never buy a cooker from IKEA or Hotpoint again",1

The way they do things seems completely stupid, if I order items online that are available then surely they should be then reserved for my order on my delivery date- well no they’re not. On the delivery day when they went to get my 17 items only 5 of them were available despite them knowing for 23 days they had to fulfil the order that I had paid for. That I had spent time saving for!

Ive been told they might not be all in stock again on that date, so they will send what they have and I will have to call them again and re-order them again. I am speechless, how long is this going to go for. It’s not like it’s easy to get through to them as-well. Honestly pathetic. Don’t take a chance and give them your money, pick up in store if you need to. Looks like they take your money and hope you forget about it.

Lies or misinformation from customer service on the phone when trying to find out where our delivery driver is. Received tracking texts that were irrelevant. Told to stay in till 7pm despite delivery due at 10am. Suffice to say was not happy when it transpired delivery was NOT coming that day at all. Then after that it was late again, missing parts of sofas, damaged table and chair. More mess around from customer service. On and on. I only offer 2 stars instead of 1 as my furniture looks good now I've built it all and 1 agent, out of all those I've had to call and email, was very helpful. I will not be shopping there again, which is sometimes an empty threat from moaning old men but I'm an angry young(ish) woman who really means it.",4
"Jan. 27, 2022",Worst customer service ever...arrogance is a small word,"The Worst!Our order was cancelled the day before delivery after a months wait.

"Updated Jan. 26, 2022",Just awful,"Dreadful customer service.  Ordered items online but couldn't be in on the first available day.  Selected next day for delivery.  Email comes through giving the first day for delivery.  Went online to change to my preferred day again.  Confirmed online.  Goods turned up on their first day!!   Luckily I was in when they came, but one of the badly packed heavy items was out of its box and damaged.  Delivery company reluctantly accepted that the item would be returned.  Called Ikea to ask them to send a replacement but was told there was nothing they could do until the item was physically back with them.  They suggest it would be at least a week to get a replacement.  Having paid £15 delivery I'd expect them to get the return info from DPD and immediately order a replacement.   Failed online service for delivery date, poor packaging of heavy items, mistrustful customer 'service' - not what I'd expect from an international brand!",2
"Jan. 26, 2022",The Worst!,"Damaged my property during delivery, lied about it, ignored the clear cut evidence I provided. Seemingly no eway to escalate. CS worst Ive ever experienced. No way to speak to a human. Several days between email replies. Don't bother answering the questions you ask or provide the information you request. Absolutely pathetic, in almost every way. Have an Ikea kitchen and tonnes of ikea furniture. Spent thousands through the years, yet thery are happy to jusy call me a liar. Whatever happened to honesty and admitting one's mistakes?

Then, they asked me to check all others for damage instead of just changing them. The boxes are massive, so had to put them on the carpet, potentially damaging the carpet. I asked them when they could collect it, and they told me first it costs the shop 40GBP so they could only came once and hence why i had to check. After waiting ten minutes on the phone to check when they could collect it, they hang up on me. Then in second call i realised it was because there was no collection possible so i had to go to the shop (a 40 min drive), and i guess he didnt want to tell me that.",1

There is no help available. A chat bot? Unhelpful. No email support. Unable to make a claim online. When I called I was held in a queue for ages and when I did eventually get through to someone they said Hello how can I help then that was it no other communication so had to drop the call I am fuming. I can’t take the products back to store because they don’t the replacement in stock. Fuming. How do I get help?",1

They gave me an option of three times slots: I chose 8pm - 9pm. I drove for 40 minutes (each way) and paid a $16 dollar toll (each way) to arrive at IKEA at 8:30; well within the window they provided. When I got to the door it was locked and there was a sign on the door saying that they have ""Winter Hours"" and they close at 8pm during the winter. So ... within the window they game me to pick up my items, they were closed. I called customer service from the parking lot. I explained the situation to the woman who answered. She put me on hold for 6 minutes and then hung up. I called back. Someone else answered. I explained the situation and they hung up while I was speaking. I drove home and tried the chat. I chatted with a rep named Judith -- she chatted with me for quite a while and then told me there was nothing she could do and that should call the customer service number. When I told her I had already tried that, she told me to try the chat again in the morning and talk to the ""concern team."" I will give this a try tomorrow, but am very skeptical that a ""concern team"" actually exists. It's shocking to me that a company this large has such abysmal customer service.",1

There are many deciding factors in my where I shop and whether a company has good ethics. Ikea have now told me they are a discriminatory company and I will never shop there again. Perhaps they will also like to cut pay to those who are off with chest infections if they are a smoker? Where does it end?,1

"Jan. 17, 2022",I will never shop in Ikea again,"I bought an IKEA kitchen, and sadly have had a terrible experience. In store service was fine, (although they should take more care when placing an order as there were extras in that we had asked to be removed) but the delivery / customer services were appalling. My booking was taken no problem but then the distribution team emailed saying parts were missing so they couldn't process it. For a few days after however I had the sales team calling telling me to pay for it. The third sales guy that called told me everything was now available and I should pay to reserve it so I did.You don't get contacted you just get emails with delivery dates booked sent to you, they don't check you can make the date or explain why you have several you just receive emails saying it's booked for delivery with no communication of install. There is no direct number to this team you have to email them but they never respond and if you call customer service they don't know what is happening. We received 2 delivery dates, one of which I am not in the country for so I rang the kitchen customer service team and asked then to change it. Instead she cancelled the whole order without asking at which point we lost our hold on the kitchen but did not know. They couldn't accommodate a simple date swap so in the end we had it rebooked for the same dates again. The installation guy was not notified instead he was texting me the customer for updates on our order due to lack of communication from IKEA.On the 23rd of December just before Xmas and 2 weeks before the majority of our kitchen was set to arrive we received an automated email saying our order had been cancelled and refunded. No forward warning no explanation. I called customer services who informed me they were missing some of our doors! So they have refunded us because they didn't have them but still intended on delivering the rest of the kitchen with no update on stock availability. When I asked what would happen the response I  got was you have to keep an eye out for them coming back on the website!! The customer has to actively look out for kitchen doors to match the kitchen ordered bearing in mind I hadn't received any info on what doors had actually been refunded either. Alternatively I could go in store and pick other doors. So now I am having a black kitchen delivered with 3 missing doors and I can pick some green ones instead, perfect! We went into store to complain who when looking at the account explained that the customer service lady who cancelled the order had in effect lost our doors. They were not surprised in fact they were used to it so this terrible delivery and customer service team that IKEA have is very much a known thing yet they do nothing about it. Our whole kitchen had to be cancelled 2 weeks before arrival and we spent Xmas searching for a new one and someone to install. We are still waiting on part of our refund 3 weeks later. We have had all the electrics and pipes changed to the IKEA spec as requested by the installation guy and now have to have it redone for the new kitchen, an expense IKEA was meant to pick up but heard nothing yet. It has been an awful experience, complicated and mis-informed from the start. The customer service team are by far one of the worst I have ever had to deal with and when you ask to talk to a manager they won't speak to you. We have completely lost faith in IKEA.",1

At time of delivery we asked if there was anythign to sign/review together like used to be the process and the delivery team told us 'no we don't do that anymore because of COVID.' Less than 5 minutes after they had left our house we realized the mistake and called the delivery team but they told us they weren't allowed to come pick up merchandise after drop off and we had to call the store. Called the store and they told us they were so understaffed that no one could handle support calls and we should call again the next day. Tried online chat and they said we needed to call the store. Called the store the next day and finally got someone who said we would have to drive the couch, which was a truckload of large boxes too heavy for us to carry and too large to fit in our cars, in order to get a refund. This is for THEIR mistake. We finally did a chargeback with our credit card company after going around in circles and getting no help for Ikea (all while our living room was filled with huge boxes for an unwanted couch and by the way, we had no couch because we had gotten our old one picked up for charity before the new couch's delivery) and Ikea send a HUGE packet of falsified 'documentation' about our case.
